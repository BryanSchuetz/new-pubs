Among the supply chain vulnerabilities laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic is the reliance that a company’s supply and distribution network has on a healthy workforce. The knock-on impact of worker ill-health affects all the companies in a supply chain, up to the multinational buyer. Without healthy workers, materials cannot be sourced, manufactured, or delivered.

Worker health has been a challenge for decades. Small and medium suppliers in emerging economies often lack the capacity, infrastructure, or regulatory framework to uphold worker health and safety. DAI’s work designing and implementing supplier workplace health and safety programs across the globe affords us insights into the key success factors multinationals should consider when developing worker health programs.

## The Most Effective Worker Health Programs Do Not Stop at the Factory gates

Managing infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and promoting worker wellbeing more broadly requires an approach that addresses the interconnectedness of society, from the workplace to the wider community.

VF Corporation, one of the world’s largest apparel, footwear, and accessories companies, takes a holistic approach to worker health challenges through its [Worker and Community Development Program (WCD)](https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/people/worker-wellbeing#:\~:text=In%202017%2C%20VF%20launched%20the%20Worker%20%26%20Community,those%20in%20local%20communities%20beyond%20its%20factory%20walls.?msclkid=2d91812faae811eca765db783803f408), which establishes safe and stable working environments in its supplier factories while improving the lives of local communities.

DAI supports VF Corporation in its supplier factories in Indonesia and Vietnam. [In Java, Indonesia, DAI works with 10 VF supplier factories](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-improving-the-health-of-female-workers-at-global-apparel-companys-factories) to improve the provision of maternal and newborn health (MNH), family planning, and sexual and gender-based violence services to the majority-female workforce. The DAI-implemented program strengthens MNH services in factory clinics, increases staff and worker MNH knowledge, and—crucially—improves referral pathways so that workers can receive more advanced treatment beyond the factory clinic. The program will reach 18,500 employees by the end of 2022 and has led to a 450 percent increase in clinic attendance.

In both countries, DAI has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and health promotion materials, and adapted procurement plans for each factory to meet their needs for personal protective equipment, self-test kits, and vaccinations. These health programs have played a role to enable companies such as VF Corporation to operate under changing pandemic restrictions.
