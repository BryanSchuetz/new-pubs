Since 2014, Chloe Messenger has worked for DAI in Europe, both in business development and project management for clients including the European Commission, the U.K. Department for International Development, the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Chloe’s passion is for civic engagement, tech4dem and democratic governance. While studying for her master’s degree in politics, security and integration, she researched the role of social media as a tool for civic engagement and activism in Russia. Her thesis looked into how Russians use Twitter as a tool to connect, inform, and be heard. As Digital Fellow at DAI’s Europe office, Chloe works across business units and donors to help integrate new technologies into development work.
