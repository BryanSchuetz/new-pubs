<p>We tackle fundamental social and economic development problems caused by <strong>inefficient markets</strong>, <strong>ineffective governance</strong>, and <strong>instability</strong>. We work with a wide range of clients, including national and local governments, bilateral and multilateral donors, private corporations, and philanthropies.</p>

<p>Since 1970, we have worked in more than 150 countries—delivering results across the spectrum of international development contexts, from stable societies and high-growth economies to challenging environments racked by political or military conflict.</p>
