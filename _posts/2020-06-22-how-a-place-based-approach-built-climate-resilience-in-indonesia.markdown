Indonesia knows climate and disaster risk: a vast archipelago of more than 18,000 islands and 230 million people, the country faces earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, drought, and rising sea level. Climate change is exacerbating these risks and compounding the vulnerabilities of the Indonesian people. As recently as 2019, for example, 11 southern provinces went more than seven months without rain. Indonesia’s low-lying islands face increasing flooding—ranging from tidal inundations to storm surges—demonstrating the need for active management of sea level rise. 






Of the close to 4,000 natural disasters Indonesia recorded in 2019, more than 80 percent were weather and climate related, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency. In January 2020, historic floods killed more than 50 people in Jakarta, Indonesia’s rapidly sinking capital, and left hundreds of thousands of people displaced. To help Indonesia address this escalating climate vulnerability and disaster risk, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s [Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-apik-adaptasi-perubahan-iklim-dan-ketangguhan-or-climate-change-adaption) project (known by its Indonesian acronym, APIK) took a place-based approach to activities—tailoring adaptation and disaster risk strategies to the contexts of East Java, Southeast Sulawesi, and Maluku. Among the project’s successes, APIK:
