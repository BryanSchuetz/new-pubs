Indonesia knows climate and disaster risk: a vast archipelago of more than 18,000 islands and 230 million people, the country faces earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, drought, and rising sea level. Climate change is exacerbating these risks and compounding the vulnerabilities of the Indonesian people. As recently as 2019, for example, 11 southern provinces went more than seven months without rain. Indonesia’s low-lying islands face increasing flooding—ranging from tidal inundations to storm surges—demonstrating the need for active management of sea level rise. 






Of the close to 4,000 natural disasters Indonesia recorded in 2019, more than 80 percent were weather and climate related, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency. In January 2020, historic floods killed more than 50 people in Jakarta, Indonesia’s rapidly sinking capital, and left hundreds of thousands of people displaced. To help Indonesia address this escalating climate vulnerability and disaster risk, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s [Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-apik-adaptasi-perubahan-iklim-dan-ketangguhan-or-climate-change-adaption) project (known by its Indonesian acronym, APIK) took a place-based approach to activities—tailoring adaptation and disaster risk strategies to the contexts of East Java, Southeast Sulawesi, and Maluku. Among the project’s successes, APIK:

* Led the revision of the Indonesian National Climate Adaptation Action Plan and provided technical input into the National Development Plan for 2020 to 2024. As a result, for the first time, the Government of Indonesia has allocated $3 billion to the climate-sensitive sectors of agriculture, water and sanitation, coastal and marine environments, and health. 
* Developed a multi-stakeholder private sector partnership with the Government of Indonesia, Cargill, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the Layer Chicken Producer Association of Indonesia to design and implement climate-smart chicken housing, resulting in a 7 percent increase in chicken production by the end of the project.
* Engaged 42,000 people in resilience-building activities in the three provinces and trained 22,250 people in climate and disaster risk reduction.
* Integrated climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction methods into 158 laws, policies, and regulations from the national to the village level.
* Supported more than 130 villages in activities including creating flood contingency plans for towns along the Panguluran river and working with local government to install early warning systems for flash floods with rainfall sensors and automatic stream-level sensors connected to information displays in villages downriver.
