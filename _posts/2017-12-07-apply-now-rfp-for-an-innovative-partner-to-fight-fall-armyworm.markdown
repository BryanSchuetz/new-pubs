Today, DAI releases a request for proposals for a prize implementation partner to confront fall armyworm head on. This partner will join DAI and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in designing a results-driven prize to find digital tools and services that help smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa.

## First, A Little Background

Right now, the fall armyworm is marching across the African continent, causing more than [$13 billion](https://www.cabi.org/Uploads/isc/Dfid%20Faw%20Inception%20Report04may2017final.pdf) in crop losses. If left unchecked, this insect could continue to cost [$6 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/25/invasion-of-maize-eating-caterpillars-worsens-hunger-crisis-in-africa-fall-armyworm) a year. What makes this pest so devastating to farmers across the region? First of all, it not only [eats](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/06/07/fall-armyworm-outbreaks-in-the-sadc-region-how-to-respond/) the vegetative parts of the plants, but also consumes the reproductive portions, completely destroying crops. Secondly, it can [fly](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/06/07/fall-armyworm-outbreaks-in-the-sadc-region-how-to-respond/) up to 1,600 kilometers (nearly 1,000 miles), meaning it can easily migrate to surrounding farms and countries. Finally, the insect [attacks](http://www.cimmyt.org/press_release/multi-pronged-approach-key-for-effectively-defeating-fall-armyworm-in-africa/) more than 80 plant species, including maize, which more than 200 million people across sub-Saharan Africa depend upon. Basically, this insect eats fast, travels far, and poses a critical threat to Africa’s food security.

In response, USAID is launching a call for innovative, digital solutions to help smallholder farmers confront fall armyworm and protect their crops. To support this call, DAI’s USAID-funded [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) project is looking for a prize implementation firm to design, launch, implement, and evaluate a results-driven prize.
