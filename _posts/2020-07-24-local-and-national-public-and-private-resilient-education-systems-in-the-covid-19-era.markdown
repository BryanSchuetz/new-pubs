The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fragility of global education systems, as many schools have temporarily ceased in-person instruction and left students with unequal, inconsistent access to learning opportunities at home. Traditional education provision may not be possible for the foreseeable future. This crisis—and the threat of potential future crisis—underscores an urgent need to develop [resilient education systems](http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/our-mission/education-system-resilience) that can withstand disruption and accommodate risk. 








A strong education system must have the requisite resources to adapt and swiftly minimize the harmful effects of disruptions. Decentralized decision making—supported by centralized oversight—and public-private partnerships are key elements that can contribute to more resilient education systems.

## Decentralized Decision Making 

Fiscal decentralization and administrative decision making can strengthen educational institutions and help ensure faster, more effective responses to disruptions. While the COVID-19 crisis is unique in its global scale, different communities and populations face challenges specific to their social, cultural, political, and economic contexts. The needs and requirements of communities to resume access to education services, and plan for continuity of instruction, are quite varied. 

To promote education resilience, we must identify the particular challenges faced by individual communities, especially by students most at risk. Teachers, school leaders, and local administrative offices are well placed to provide insights into these needs, informing responses that are tailored to specific contexts. Provincial and local institutions are best positioned to gather this information through primary data collection methods or anecdotal evidence from parents, students, and the community. 

[Evidence from a 2004 study in Bolivia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272702001858) suggests that decentralized education systems are  responsive to local needs and are better suited for planning and implementing regionally relevant, culturally appropriate solutions in large, diverse countries. To be successful, a decentralized governance system must have the agency and scope to allocate resources efficiently. For example, as a result of decentralization, Bolivia’s national investment in education increased in areas with a greater need for education spending (as indicated by their low literacy levels). 

Jordan is one country that has found ways to adjust its COVID-19 strategy to serve specific communities at the sub-national level. The Ministry of Education is communicating instruction to students by broadcasting lessons on television and sharing them on digital platforms. While 70 percent of children have reportedly accessed these platforms, those who belong to vulnerable groups—such as refugee children in temporary settlements—are often unable to access these lessons because they lack internet connectivity, digital devices, and data packages. 

To respond to the needs of vulnerable groups, the Ministry of Education made its distance teaching website data free (during certain hours) and increased the daily duration of electricity supply to refugee camps so children can watch televised lessons. This approach only goes so far, however: children still need access to the right digital devices to continue learning through distance education platforms.
