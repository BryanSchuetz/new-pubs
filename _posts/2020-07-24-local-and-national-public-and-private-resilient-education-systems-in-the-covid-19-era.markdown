The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fragility of global education systems, as many schools have temporarily ceased in-person instruction and left students with unequal, inconsistent access to learning opportunities at home. Traditional education provision may not be possible for the foreseeable future. This crisis—and the threat of potential future crisis—underscores an urgent need to develop [resilient education systems](http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/our-mission/education-system-resilience) that can withstand disruption and accommodate risk. 








A strong education system must have the requisite resources to adapt and swiftly minimize the harmful effects of disruptions. Decentralized decision making—supported by centralized oversight—and public-private partnerships are key elements that can contribute to more resilient education systems.
