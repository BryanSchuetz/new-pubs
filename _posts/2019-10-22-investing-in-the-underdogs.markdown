Since 2012, DAI has worked to deepen reforms introduced by Burma’s military-led government and sustain long-term stability through a combination of multisectoral, coordinated programming with a focus on promoting local leadership. Equipping key stakeholders with training on relevant issues, reducing barriers to them being heard, and strengthening opportunities for collaboration and coordination on social issues have proven helpful in promoting peace and addressing intercommunal conflict. 





As the [U.S. Integrated Country Strategy](https://www.state.gov/state-gov-website-modernization/) advises, one of the best ways to ensure a nascent democracy remains stable and becomes increasingly responsive to its people’s needs is to invest “across a wider spectrum of society to identify and cultivate” leaders who will drive progress.

### Ms. Representation

Women comprise one of these groups that hasn’t been fully leveraged yet. The [Framework for Political Dialogue](http://www.eprpinformation.org/files/recent-events/the-framework-for-political-dialogue-unofficial-translation--22dec2015--eng.pdf) created to guide peace process talks in Burma specifies that at least 30 percent of delegates to Union Peace Conferences (UPC) should be women—but participation has consistently fallen short. In Parliament, the numbers are even more woeful. As of 2018, only 10.2 percent of seats were held by women. Women in Burma have limited opportunities to become technical experts in relevant areas and often are unable to afford transportation and pay for the childcare necessary to attend formal events where they would be able to voice their concerns. 

In response to these barriers, DAI’s [Center for Secure and Stable States (CS3)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/fragile-states) has trained 675 women in Burma on peace process themes such as federalism, security sector reform, and economic policy so they can make meaningful contributions. CS3 created a Women’s Participation Fund to cover childcare, transportation, and lodging. While the last UPC saw an increase from 17 percent to 22 percent attendance by women, work remains to more fully integrate women’s concerns into national level policy. CS3 has mapped the networks of influential women who are working on the peace process to facilitate coordination between like-minded stakeholders. As peace negotiations proceed, there continues to be a need to consolidate gender perspectives and lessons learned and strengthen coordination across key stakeholders.

### Minority Inclusion?

Success in Burma will only be possible if the national government is able to reconcile with its ethnic minorities and bring an end to decades of conflict. The third Session of the 21st Century Panglong Conference—aimed to forge a nationwide ceasefire—[made little progress](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11068.pdf) toward ending the conflict and some of the largest ethnic armed organizations, including the Karen National Union and the Restoration Council of Shan State, suspended their involvement in the formal peace process and many others are increasingly hesitant to engage. 

However, ethnic armed organizations are increasingly exploring alternative forums and informal negotiations. Ethnic minorities have often been marginalized and lacked opportunities to gain technical expertise needed to articulate constructive policy positions during negotiations. In the last few years, DAI has leveraged a similar formula with ethnic groups as with women by providing training on topics relevant to the peace process, providing logistical support for transportation and accommodation to reduce barriers to attendance, and building networks of ethnic armed organizations, and civil society organizations to strengthen coordination. 

Ethnic armed organization representatives who received support reported being taken more seriously in peace discussions as a result of the skills they learned in training and have been able to effectively coordinate amongst themselves as well. For example, 12 ethnic armed organizations were able come to a consensus on natural resource management and signed a joint policy. A need for similar types of technical training and logistical support continue as ethnic armed organizations keep looking for ways to achieve peace.  

### Nipping Tensions in the Bud

As nationalism has deepened in Burma in the last few years, communal tensions have also risen and sparked violence along religious and ethnic lines across various communities. The rapid adoption of mobile phones and internet usage since 2014 has complicated the already tense environment by expanding access to information and opening opportunities for the dissemination of misleading and false messaging that can provoke conflict. For example, as [fighting continues](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/myanmars-rakhine-buddhsts-rohingya.html) between the Buddhist Arakan Army in Rakhine state and the national military, hate speech has also escalated between civilians exacerbating an already tense situation.

Ethnic tensions in Burma are not going to disappear any time soon, but equipping and empowering community leaders to monitor and squash misinformation has proven effective in reducing violence. DAI has helped strengthen communication networks by securely sharing contact information between key stakeholders and creating encrypted messaging groups to facilitate quick connection. 

In the Mandalay region, this type of partner network was able to prevent violence related to the construction of a mosque by coordinating with local authorities and encouraging residents to stay in their homes. DAI has also supported the development of learning curricula focused on dispute resolution, conflict mitigation, and media literacy to produce a generation of more savvy leaders and information consumers who know to analyze the intentions of messaging they encounter. These efforts have seen success among conventional partners such as activists as well as with less conventional partners such as residents of internally displaced camps who reported that the training they received helped them understand how information has been manipulated and helped to reduce their anger against other groups. 

Supporting decentralized leadership has direct benefits for peace negotiations and reducing communal violence, but also has implications for the broader political currents in Burma. With elections approaching in 2020, promoting a culture that is guarded against violence-provoking hate speech related to ethnicity and religion and capable of articulating constructive policy positions also helps set the stage for more civil discussions around how Burma’s democracy can deliver progress to all its people.
