In rural Ethiopia, land represents dignity and identity. More concretely, holding a certified land title means better prospects for economic independence, stable income, and bargaining power. When it comes to receiving legal recognition as landholders, women and members of other vulnerable, systemically disenfranchised groups have the most to gain. 

However, women and the vulnerable are also the most likely to slip through the cracks of land certification programs. They risk becoming targets for fraud, discrimination, deception—even violence—in the process of claiming their land rights. 

In our work implementing a U.K. Department for International Development land certification project in Ethiopia—Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT)—our goal is to improve land tenure security for farmers, with a special focus on women. 

Nearly 90 percent of the 9 million land certificates LIFT has issued in Ethiopia now include women as joint landholders. Women and girls are more frequently inheriting land titles and more women in polygamous households now have recognized land rights. And women and marginalized individuals are increasingly bringing land dispute cases to local officials, the police, and the courts, demonstrating their sense of agency and desire to seek justice. 
LIFT’s process is detailed and thorough, with specific steps to ensure public awareness, correct land demarcation, and dispute resolution. Even so, women and vulnerable groups can face land rights violations.

To better understand the scope for, causes of, and solutions to land-related violence and social inclusion challenges, LIFT commissioned two studies across four regions of Ethiopia.  Our gender specialists sought out land claim disputes that involved women, the elderly, orphaned children, heads of destitute households, and individuals facing other challenges such as addiction or disability. 




Ethiopian women face a wide range of obstacles in protecting their land rights. 
•	Cultural norms and perceptions: Tradition in most regions regards men as farmers and women as homemakers who do not “need” as much land as men. Land rights are typically only inherited by sons. Women can lose their land rights upon marriage, divorce, or widowhood. 
•	Lack of literacy and legal knowledge: Women are heavily disadvantaged by illiteracy and low awareness of land law. Legal terms are difficult to understand and the procedures for filing a case to resolve a land dispute are complex. Many women are unaware of the implications of failing to pursue their holding rights and perceive following land cases as unnecessary. 
•	Access to information: By custom, women tend not to attend public meetings. When they do attend, it is considered more appropriate for men to do the talking. In multilingual communities, women commonly speak only their ethnic group’s language and struggle to participate without translation. Orphans and the disabled rely on caregivers for information presented at meetings, who often fail to relay it correctly to them. 
•	Access to services: Although resources to assist in land registration are free, accessing them often involves traveling long distances—a substantial outlay of time and money that presents a major burden for women and vulnerable groups with few financial resources.  Unpaid household responsibilities such as childcare limit women’s flexibility to attend meetings or seek out assistance.
•	Power dynamics: Unequal power relations make vulnerable groups easy targets of land rights violations. Long-term tenants with means or connections may be able to claim land owned by vulnerable smallholders, encroach on their land, illegally occupy their land, or deny them of their inheritance. Some rightful landholders may not have the social or economic resources to confront violators, and therefore give up their claims. 

These barriers to inclusion are present at every stage of the land certification process:
