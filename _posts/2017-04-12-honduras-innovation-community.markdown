`Chronogram of the 2016 Honduras Startup accelerator from hondurastartup.com`

In December 2016, I spent a month in Honduras helping launch the new [USAID Local Governance Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-local-governance-activity-hlg) and, replicating some work I did in [El Salvador](https://dai-global-digital.com/innovation-and-entrepreneurship-in-el-salvador.html) last year, I decided to get to know the innovation and technology community. Why?

DAI is currently launching *four* new USAID-funded projects in Honduras: local governance, a [justice & human rights project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-justice-human-rights-and-security-strengthening-activity-jhrss), [an environmental governance project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-ProParque-GEMA), and the new [school-based violence prevention](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-school-based-violence-prevention-activity-sbvpa) project. My goal in writing this piece is the same as it was when I wrote [Hey USAID, Want to Promote Innovation?](https://dai-global-digital.com/hey-usaid-want-to-promote-innovation.html): to get those new projects to think creatively about how to achieve their goals.

With mobile phones flooding the Honduran market—as we found through our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/honduras-digital-insights.html) work there last year—the opportunity to reach people in both urban and rural areas through their phones is particularly ripe in Honduras. Tech entrepreneurs are adept at understanding people's needs, creating prototypes, rapidly testing them, improving them, and then rolling them out to the public. This iterative process is called agile design, and it is industry standard among tech folks. As we're working with Honduran communities to look for new solutions to social problems, we'll be looking to the tech community to help us implement an agile process.

In short: Top-down, proposal-defined, pre-proscribed solutions are out; co-created, tech-enabled, iterative solutions are in. The challenge is working with USAID to design an agile process that still includes all the typical reporting and budgeting requirements remain in place. But, utilizing the talents of Honduras’s technology and innovation community, we can and will find a middle ground, as we are doing in Guatemala with the development of the [mobile municipal transparency app](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-guatemala.html).

So, with no further delay, our Honduran innovators:
