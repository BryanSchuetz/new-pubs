Nigeria has Africa’s largest economy and population. But as recently as 2016, the country ranked near the bottom of the World Bank’s *[Ease of Doing Business](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness)* index, which measures business regulations and their enforcement worldwide. Nigeria’s low ranking [that year](https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB16-Full-Report.pdf)—169 out of 190 countries—reflected the difficulty businesses faced in dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, paying taxes, and trading across borders.  

Today, although Nigeria is grappling with the COVID-19 health and economic crisis that has swept the globe, its business regulations look different. Recent economic reforms have removed some bureaucratic hurdles. As of [2020](https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/country/n/nigeria/NGA.pdf), the country has risen 34 places on the index and has been named a top 10 improving economy by the World Bank. 

How? Doing business has gotten easier in Nigeria thanks to reforms led by the [Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council](https://easeofdoingbusinessnigeria.com/) (PEBEC) and supported by the UKaid-funded [Policy Development Facility Phase II](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-dfid-policy-development-facility-pdf2-0) (PDF II). The facility, implemented by DAI between 2015 and 2020, worked with government officials to improve economic and social policies. 

In March 2020, PDF II celebrated its completion. The milestone was made more significant as the project received a special recognition award from PEBEC.
