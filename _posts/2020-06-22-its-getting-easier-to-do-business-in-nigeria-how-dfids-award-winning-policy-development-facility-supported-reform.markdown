Nigeria has Africa’s largest economy and population. But as recently as 2016, the country ranked near the bottom of the World Bank’s *[Ease of Doing Business](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness)* index, which measures business regulations and their enforcement worldwide. Nigeria’s low ranking [that year](https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB16-Full-Report.pdf)—169 out of 190 countries—reflected the difficulty businesses faced in dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, paying taxes, and trading across borders.










  

Today, although Nigeria is grappling with the COVID-19 health and economic crisis that has swept the globe, its business regulations look different. Recent economic reforms have removed some bureaucratic hurdles. As of [2020](https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/country/n/nigeria/NGA.pdf), the country has risen 34 places on the index and has been named a top 10 improving economy by the World Bank. 

How? Doing business has gotten easier in Nigeria thanks to reforms led by the [Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council](https://easeofdoingbusinessnigeria.com/) (PEBEC) and supported by the UKaid-funded [Policy Development Facility Phase II](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-dfid-policy-development-facility-pdf2-0) (PDF II). The facility, implemented by DAI between 2015 and 2020, worked with government officials to improve economic and social policies. 

In March 2020, PDF II celebrated its completion. The milestone was made more significant as the project received a special recognition award from PEBEC.  

## Championing Change

A flexible, rapid-response facility, PDF II supported “champions of change” to implement economic and social policies to reduce poverty in Nigeria. These champions were primarily federal ministers and high-level officials such as the Office of the Vice President, but also included National Assembly Committees and nongovernment actors such as civil society organizations (CSOs). 

The facility helped the Nigerian government make its ministries, departments, and agencies more efficient, leading to substantial financial savings and increased transparency. PDF II’s work focused on addressing constraints to economic growth and building the evidence base required for reform.
Along with promoting clean energy through the Rural Electrification Agency, enhancing trade and investment through the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, and promoting efficiency through support to the Ministry of Finance, PDF II contributed to a national reform process that supports entrepreneurs and removes barriers to doing business. 

PDF II’s efforts [resulted](file://C:\\Users\cmiller\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\BC9XPTXO\legacy brochure.pdf) in: 

* **27,765 jobs** directly and indirectly created through interventions such as the Energizing Economies Initiative, green bonds, innovation hubs, and fertilizer programs. 
* **116 advisers** embedded across 155 projects to support Nigeria’s reforms for poverty reduction and economic growth.
* **616 million naira****** disbursed through the Development Bank of Nigeria to 300 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (and another 1.5 billion naira made available for those firms).
* More than **N25 billion** raised by the government in Sovereign Green Bonds.

UKaid’s investment made a difference. For every pound the British government spent on technical assistance, Nigeria was able to save £3,953 in excess expenditure, and an additional £89 to support budgetary expenditure.

“Through technical support provided by PDF II, we developed a roadmap that articulated the vision for the advancement of the mining sector,” says Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Nigeria’s former Minister of Solid Minerals Development and current Executive Governor of Ekiti State.

Another partner, Auditor General of the Federation Anthony Ayine, thanked PDF II for “the technical support provided in the development of our five-year strategic development plan that laid the foundation for audit reforms in Nigeria.”

PDF II’s impacts extended to business owners and individuals. Through the project’s capacity building programs, “I have upped my game in quality standards and measures, which has helped me access higher value markets,” says Osagie Azeta, CEO of Crop Safe Agro-Services. “My sales have improved, I have finally exported for the first time, and I also supply products to other exporters. I have two streams of income now.”
