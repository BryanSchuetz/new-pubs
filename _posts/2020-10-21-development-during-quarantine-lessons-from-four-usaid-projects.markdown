Mobility is fundamental to global development work. People, materials, and information must reach areas that can be geographically remote or underserved by communication infrastructures. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed—perhaps permanently—an industry that can no longer rely on access to travel and face-to-face engagement. With COVID-19 a global reality for the foreseeable future, how can development projects continue to have strong impact when travel restrictions, social distancing, and remote work requirements are the new normal?








DAI’s projects around the world have spent recent months adapting to this new reality. In some instances, they have successfully pivoted in-person activities to the digital space. In others—particularly in areas that lack digital infrastructure—project leaders have creatively adapted to further their objectives in new ways. 

Staff from four projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)—in the Philippines, Liberia, South Sudan, and Honduras—shared strategies for making a difference across physical distance. 

### Taking Environmental Enforcement Digital in the Philippines

The [USAID Philippines Protect Wildlife Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-protect-wildlife-protect) works to conserve biodiversity while supporting sustainable livelihoods for local populations, particularly in Palawan, a biodiversity hotspot dubbed the “last ecological frontier” of the Philippines. In partnership with Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), Protect Wildlife helps combat illegal wildlife trafficking and habitat destruction in the province. These are the kind of activities that, by definition, often require travel and must take place in-person—from venturing into protected areas for environmental crime enforcement training, to reaching remote communities, to conducting biodiversity research in the field. 

A two-month quarantine for Palawan at the onset of the pandemic posted a challenge for the project’s efforts. Protect Wildlife found ways to keep two initiatives moving forward in the digital space. 

The new Biodiversity Resources Access Information Network (BRAIN) System, developed with PCSD and launched on May 1, is a centralized database that supports online permitting, patrol management for officials, public reporting on environmental crime incidences, and case management. While the tool had been in the works since 2018, the project accelerated its launch in response to the quarantine. 

In protected areas of Palawan, PCSD issues permits for activities such as wildlife collection and special use and local transport. In the past, these processes required in-person submission of physical paperwork. The new digital process lets PCSD personnel accept applications electronically, allowing the permitting process to continue safely despite COVID-19 restrictions. As of a few weeks ago, eight permits have been issued using the BRAIN System, mostly covering shipments of live reef fish for food trade.

Protect Wildlife also adjusted its approach to a public education campaign. The project’s Wild and Alive Campaign aims to reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife products through educational messaging posted at transportation and tourism hubs. After pilots in 2018 and 2019 in Manila, Protect Wildlife was just starting to expand the campaign to other provinces when the pandemic struck. 

With restrictions on travel and transportation, the tourism industry came to a halt. Suddenly, the primary audience for Wild and Alive changed from tourists and travelers to people sheltering at home. The project was forced to reconsider its platform and content. 

Protect Wildlife quickly reached out to partners—ranging from national parks to government agencies like the Department of Environment and Natural Resources—and turned Wild and Alive into a social media movement. The campaign now targets audiences in their homes with messages that encourage learning more about biodiversity, feeling responsible for protection of wildlife from illegal trade, making online pledges, and influencing personal networks. The team is also studying how to position biodiversity conservation and the illegal wildlife trade as public health concerns, making the topics even more relevant to the global situation.

### Recognizing Creative Solutions in Liberia

[USAID Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-local-empowerment-government-inclusion-and-transparency-legit) is in its fifth and final year supporting Liberia’s efforts to decentralize its political institutions and improve service delivery. Over four years, LEGIT has developed a range of governance tools and resources for county administrations and city corporation partners—and was planning to spend its final near focusing on sustaining impact after the close of the project. 

Then, COVID-19 made its way to Liberia and the government declared a state of emergency and lockdown. The LEGIT team immediately asked: Could the project continue to focus on sustainability while also supporting the government’s COVID-19 response? And, importantly: Without the ability to conduct face-to-face meetings, what was even possible in rural, remote parts of the country where communications capacity and resources were limited? 

To start, LEGIT identified which of its tools and resources could best support county and municipal pandemic response. Keeping long-term sustainability in mind, the team focused on helping partners implement standard operating procedures that aligned with COVID-19 efforts. 

This work took place in remote counties of Liberia where internet access is undependable at best, electricity is sporadic, and many of the roads are inaccessible during the rainy season. Since most of LEGIT’s partners had mobile phones, or access to one, phone conversations replaced in-person visits as the project’s main form of engagement with partners. While unreliable phone service and connectivity expenses still makes communication difficult, the LEGIT team has found ways to stay in regular contact with partners.
