Spurred on by decarbonization commitments, governments, and the private sector are looking for new ways of reducing emissions to achieve Net Zero targets. This quest has renewed interest in the role of forests in avoiding emissions and sequestering carbon, as well as the part played by supply chains in driving deforestation. Reducing forest conversion is one of the most cost-effective options for reducing emissions, alongside solar and wind energy promotion, according to the latest [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/figures/summary-for-policymakers/figure-spm-7/) report (April 2022).




In the lead-up to COP26, the world’s largest financial institutions—representing $130 trillion in assets—signed up to the [Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)](https://www.gfanzero.com/), committing to reach Net Zero by 2050 and halve emissions by 2030. The Glasgow leaders’ [declaration on forests and land use](https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/) saw $12 billion allocated by donor governments and $7 billion by the private sector to fight deforestation and land degradation. Other initiatives include the recent European Union regulation to minimize [EU-driven deforestation and forest degradation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_5919). 

Such financial commitments and policies are a necessary first step. But it is equally necessary to understand the delivery mechanisms and financial models available to apply such funding and to grasp the incentives driving sustainable land use, in particular those at work in the private sector. Too often, that knowledge is in short supply. To address this shortfall in Brazil, DAI carried out a scoping study for the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The idea was to better understand the factors influencing deforestation in this critically important country—home to more than 12 percent of the world’s forest—and to explore innovative financial models which could lead to reduced emissions and greater sustainability. 

Brazil is a relatively mature market—it has financial institutions and infrastructure to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as international corporations and supply chains. We found a diverse mix of public sector interventions, public-private partnerships, and corporate initiatives, each with distinct innovations and benefits, making the country a great learning ground for other geographies and contexts. In this article, we briefly highlight three innovative financial models currently operating in Brazil’s Amazon states.
