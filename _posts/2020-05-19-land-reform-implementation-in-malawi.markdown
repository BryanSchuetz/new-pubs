In 2016, the Government of Malawi enacted a Customary Land Act (CLA), enabling smallholder farmers to convert their customary land rights to private land rights with registered title. Crucially, the CLA gives land holders increased tenure security, which in turn is hoped to lead to increased investment in land improvements.





Since 2016, two donor-funded programmes have been working to pilot the CLA’s implementation, with the intention of an eventual large-scale rollout. DAI works on one of these programmes, the [Technical Cooperation to Strengthen National Capacity in Implementing Land Policies and Laws Efficiently and Effectively](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/malawi-technical-cooperation-to-strengthen-national-capacity-in-implementing-land-policies-and-laws-efficiently-and-effectively-land-governance) (Land Governance), funded by the European Union. Under this programme, a consortium of nongovernmental organizations led by Oxfam Malawi, is piloting registration in three districts across Malawi: Kasungu, Phalombe, and Rumphi. DAI advises the consortium on the technical methodology and support the Ministry in drafting legal regulations. 

Now in their fourth year, the pilots have highlighted a number of lessons, both technical and cultural, which will help inform any future national registration effort. The following is a summary of a white paper on these lessons.

### From Fixed to General Boundaries

The pilots use a general boundary approach, which has seen success elsewhere on the continent and is useful when dealing with rural parcels at scale. Despite increasing buy-in for this method, it does represent a shift change from previous methodologies in Malawi which have typically used fixed boundary principles. This fixed method requires more precision and is much more expensive. Furthermore, more surveying capacity will be required to deliver registration at scale. Currently, Malawi has too few licensed surveyors to meet the demands of mass registration, and the introduction of para-surveyors can help with this. 

Currently, technical work is overseen by employees from the Ministry, which is fine on a small scale, but won’t be practical when considering a national programme. Capacity needs to be developed to ensure technical work is not reliant on civil servants.

### Sustaining Change 

While pilots are progressing with registration, investment in district land registries remains low. Only three exist in Malawi, in the largest cities of Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu. The new Registered Land Act requires the creation of district land registries, but there is no funding to create these at present. Funding and a clear workplan of development will be required for land registries before any large registration programmes can begin. 

### Gender: Two Customs Under One Framework

Malawi is spilt by two customary systems: matrilineal, typically practiced in southern and central regions, operating in approximately 45 percent of villages—and patrilineal, more prevalent in the north, and thought to apply to around 30 percent of villages. Therefore, men and women’s rights appear to differ, depending on which system you find yourself under. In spite of this customary practice, the new land laws provide one overall framework for securing land rights. This represents challenges in implementation—for example, one pilot was forced to relocate due to increasing resistance to the new laws. This demonstrates the need for a gradual and participatory implementation of laws, which can allow the time and space to encourage buy-in from local communities and authorities.

### Need for Local Buy-in

In much the same way that customary systems need to be well understood to appreciate differing gender dynamics, the success of pilots also hinges on understanding relationships between communities and their traditional authorities and chiefs. In Malawi, the connection between these groups is strong, with farmers only participating in the programme with the blessing of local chiefdoms. This underscores the need to respect and include these long-standing institutions, recognising customary and statutory practice. It is also a technical consideration for programmes: problems occurred in which farmers had allegiance with chiefs from a different group village area to the one their farm was in, and consequently refused to take part in the programme as their chief had not been consulted. This demonstrates the need for flexibility in programming and the differing factors between cultural and administrative boundaries. 

### Moving Forward

The above is a snapshot of the lessons and challenges to overcome before moving to large-scale implementation, but the opportunities for transforming rural land rights with increased security of tenure are huge. It will require a determined and coordinated approach from the Malawi Government, supported by the donor community over a long period of time, to achieve the objectives.

Moving forward, the key issues which need to be addressed in order to obtain donor support and thus achieve widespread implementation of the Customary Land Act are:

* Successful pilot implementation that can be shown to be scaleable.
* Increasing efficiency of the technical methodology.
* Developing supervisory skills in the short-term contract staff, so that implementation is not dependent on large numbers of civil servants. 
* Focussing initially on traditional land management areas where the traditional authorities give strong support.
* Being sensitive to local customs while still supporting gender equality.
