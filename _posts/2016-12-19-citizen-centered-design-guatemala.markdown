Back in late 2015, the [Nexos Locales](https://www.facebook.com/USAID.NexosLocales/) project received a novel inquiry. It was from Carlos Alvarado Figueroa, who had just been elected mayor of [Chiantla](https://goo.gl/maps/5vfAjrmthUM2) (CHEE-ahn-tlah), a municipality of 75,000 in the Western Highlands of Guatemala, and he had an idea. Mayor Alvarado had just been elected on a platform of budget transparency and social audit, and was part of a group of good governance reformers who swept into office on the heels of the [Línea](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/guatemala-s-government-corruption-scandals-explained) corruption scandal, which saw President Otto Perez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti both jailed. Mayor Alvarado’s idea was to create a mobile phone-based tool to give the citizens of Chiantla better access to municipal government, and he wondered if Nexos Locales could help. In particular, he wanted to give Chiantlecos an easy, transparent view on how his government was allocating and spending money, making social audit easier and giving citizens the ability to monitor and critique. So, the project called me, and I called Mayor Alvarado.

# Citizen-Centered Design

After a few rounds of discussions, and consultation with the Nexos Locales project team, we agreed to a citizen-centered design process. Meaning that we involved Chiantlecos in our design process from beginning to end, starting with face-to-face interviews on key design factors such as; access to mobile technology, information flows via traditional and new media, app choice and social media ecosystem, citizen opinion of government performance and transparency, and which municipal services they would like to access via the municipality. 

If this sounds familiar, that’s because it's similar ground to what our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) process covers. The primary difference was that the interviews were conducted by a partner: a local NGO called [ADESJU](https://www.facebook.com/Asociaci%C3%B3n-Para-el-Desarrollo-Sostenible-de-la-Juventud-130288017040702/).

They interviewed 100 citizens in the city center, periphery, and in the rural highlands. Half were men, half were women, and a wide range of ages was represented, from 16 to 70. 30 were part of the local municipal civil society advisory council.  Below is a sample of what we found, followed by some discussion of how it impacted our design process.

# Key observations & discussion.

* There were a lot of smartphones. While this is not a scientifically representative sample, we were surprised that 58% of our interviewees had one. The smartphones skewed urban, likely due to cost and accessibility. This gives us confidence that there is a market for a tool accessible via smartphone. We chose to build an app over a mobile-first web page because data is at a premium and we wanted to limit the amount of data people needed to download each time they use the tool. Certainly there will be challenges (getting people to download it in the first place, ensuring they have enough space on their phones) but I’m confident that by working through our municipal and civil society partners, we can address these challenges. 

* Facebook and WhatsApp were hugely popular and accessed primarily via mobile.  We’ll be looking for ways to take advantage of both. Currently one of the four key components is a direct link to the municipality’s Facebook page, which is updated with information, events, and photos multiple times a day. Given its popularity, we see this as a viable forum for creating more citizen engagement. Of course not everyone has access to Facebook, so in the future we’ll be looking for ways to engage that population through SMS and in-person events.

* When asked, the most requested functionality was budget transparency. This will be a core component of our final product, and we’ve been working closely with Guatemala’s [municipal budget and expenditure data system](http://portalgl.minfin.gob.gt/Paginas/PortalGobiernosLocales.aspx) via the Ministry of Finance’s [Office of Municipal Financial Assistance](http://www.minfin.gob.gt/index.php/noticias-minfin-2014/1707-19-la-direccion-de-asistencia-a-la-administracion-financiera-municipal-daafim-habilita-oficinas-de-atencion-para-municipalidades) (DAAFIM for its name in Spanish).  

# Where to next?

Currently we’re moving forward with a design team based in Guatemala City. Originally I had hoped to find a design and development team in Chiantla, Huehuetenango, or Quetzaltenango (where Nexos is based), and while there are a few software developers in those areas of the Western Highlands, we ended up finding an excellent team with civic tech experience in Guatemala City. They’re led by the very clever folks at [Explico Analytics](http://explicoanalytics.com/) and [Ludiverse](http://www.ludiverse.net/). At the moment we're running a local contest to find an appropriate name for the app, planning a couple rounds of user testing in February, working with our partners in the municipality on a communications and outreach plan, and hoping to have the app fully launched by May. More soon!
