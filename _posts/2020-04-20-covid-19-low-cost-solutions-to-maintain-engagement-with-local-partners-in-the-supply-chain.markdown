Local content practitioners—particularly those working in the sustainability, contracts, procurement, and supply chain departments of large companies—face enormous pressure from two sides: on one side, the pressing need to reduce costs in light of cratering economic activity across the board, and particularly in the energy sector; on the other side, the need—and increasingly the obligation—to engage with their local partners and carry them through this crisis. The challenge, by no means insuperable, is how to reconcile these two imperatives.





## SMEs in Supply Chain are Particularly Vulnerable

Local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—and perhaps especially SMEs in the energy and mining industry—are inherently vulnerable in this and other times of crisis:
* First, most SMEs lack the banking facilities and scale to make cost-cutting and refinancing decisions comparable to those now being executed by big multinationals or other large companies.
* Second, they tend to be relatively new businesses that lack the industry experience and knowledge to have developed their own crisis or risk mitigation plans, which are essential to chart a path forward.
* Third, most do not have a diversified client base; a “single customer” company, but especially in the energy supply chain, finds itself particularly vulnerable today.

## Multinationals Now Occupy a Critical Market Role for SMEs

Today, the onus is on multinationals—especially “forward leaning” multinationals in the energy and mining sector—to alleviate the pressure on their local supply partners. Why? Because these large companies often serve as single, trusted sources of market information, capacity building, and technical expertise for local SMEs. In today’s markets, this position as a de-facto mentor should be acknowledged either as a contractual obligation (ratified at a contractual level and/or at a legal or regulatory level through local content requirements) or as an implicit undertaking for sustainably minded multinationals with a long-term vision.

This mantle of trust means even more during a downturn. It is times of crisis that really test multinationals’ commitment to local SMEs and stakeholders, and will either give the lie—or give comfort—to the skeptics who see the progressive multinational as a contradiction in terms.
