Approximately three-fourths the size of California, the Philippines is brimming with biodiversity. It is among the world’s 17 megadiverse countries that host more than 70 percent of the world’s plant and animal species. However, systems and local capacity to conserve, protect, and channel rich biodiversity and ecosystems toward sustainable development are underdeveloped—leaving the country’s more than 700 threatened species and their habitats at high risk to unchecked resource extraction, poaching, and illegal trade. 

In 2014, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Biodiversity Policy addressed the very issues facing the Philippines. By 2016, the agency launched the DAI-led [Protect Wildlife](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-protect-wildlife-protect) activity to align conservation policy with on-the-ground wildlife management and enforcement in the Philippines. The activity worked in target landscapes and seascapes to reduce threats to biodiversity, reduce poaching and use of illegally harvested wildlife species and byproducts, and improve ecosystem goods and services for human wellbeing.  

 




## Allure of Wildlife Makes Philippines a Criminal Target 

Its geography and highly dispersed natural resources make the Philippines one of the greatest draws for poaching, trafficking, and illegal trade of wildlife species and byproducts. Illegal wildlife trade is the fourth-largest illicit trade in the world—behind weapons, drugs, and people. The Asian Development Bank estimates the value of trafficked Philippine wildlife and resources at roughly $23 billion.  

Notable interdictions and seizures in recent years include 450 endangered animals valued at $1 million from Indonesia in April 2019, 1,100 kilos of pangolin scales valued at nearly $1 million in September 2019, more than 120,000 tons of giant clam shells worth approximately $41 million from General Santos City in October 2019, and 40 live pangolins valued at approximately $16,000 seized in July 2018 and January 2020 operations in Palawan. 

Wildlife trafficking networks leverage weak points in natural resources governance and enforcement—upland and rural poverty, limited coordination between enforcement units, and uneven capacity—to manage poaching and trafficking of wildlife and transshipment through the Philippines to end-markets. Traffickers corrupt local communities who engage as poachers and consolidators, and officials who act as fixers to facilitate transport and arrange export via forged paperwork and other forms of smuggling. Increasingly, international crime syndicates execute transactions online to hide illegal finances and protect network leaders.
