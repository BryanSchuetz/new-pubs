Jeffery Mecaskey is the Team Leader of the [Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-tackling-deadly-diseases-in-africa-program), a project designed to strengthen health security in Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Uganda. TDAAP is funded by UK Aid and led by DAI Global Health.

We recently sat with Jeff to discuss measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries. [An article](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/98/11/20-252742.pdf) he co-authored analyses data from 20 low- and middle-income countries to identify common deficiencies in primary healthcare provision. The article argues PHC is an accessible way to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and makes practical, evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice.





**Jeff, remind us why UHC matters.**

"It’s pretty simple, really. All we have to do is look at what happens when universal health coverage isn’t there. Millions of people every year are thrown into poverty by catastrophic health expenditure. Imagine being in a situation where you have to sell your livestock or your house so you can afford life-saving treatment. This is exactly what happens where UHC doesn’t exist. Households headed by women are hit particularly hard. Many people are forced to choose not to get help, because they can’t afford it.

"Different countries have different ways of achieving UHC. Some pay for it through taxation, like the UK, some have social insurance schemes in place. The public-private balance in how care is provided also differs in many places. That’s the thing about UHC, it’s not one-size-fits all. Things always work best when they’re tailored to local contexts. What matters is that provision is equitable and efficient.

"Health is a right, but UHC is crucial even if you take a pragmatic, rather than normative approach. Societies where people are denied the minimum they need to live safe lives are often not the most stable. It’s in everyone’s interest everywhere that we get this right."

**Your paper focuses on primary healthcare? What’s important about it?**

"A couple of decades ago, the idea of community-centred care gained currency. It’s empowering, affordable, and culturally appropriate. A community health worker will likely be someone you know and who understands you. Your community health worker will be able to offer you a wide range of basic health services, hopefully free, but if not usually very cheaply. Obviously, they often only have basic training, so you wouldn’t be using them if you needed a C-section. But that community health worker would help you know if you needed that C-section and refer you to suitable care. These community health workers are the foundation of a system that can offer an accessible option both for the health authority and the end-user."
