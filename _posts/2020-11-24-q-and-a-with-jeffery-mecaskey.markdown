Jeffery Mecaskey is the Team Leader of the [Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-tackling-deadly-diseases-in-africa-program), a project designed to strengthen health security in Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Uganda. TDAAP is funded by UK Aid and led by DAI Global Health.

We recently sat with Jeff to discuss measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries. [An article](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/98/11/20-252742.pdf) he co-authored analyses data from 20 low- and middle-income countries to identify common deficiencies in primary health care (PHC) provision. The article argues PHC is an accessible way to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and makes practical, evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice.
