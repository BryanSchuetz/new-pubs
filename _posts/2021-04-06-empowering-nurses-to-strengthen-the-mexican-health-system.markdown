Mexico is facing numerous challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and, simultaneously, a historically high burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including some of the highest prevalence rates of hypertension, obesity, and [diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1299074/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20recent%20national,where%20crude%20prevalence%20is%20higher.). People with [underlying chronic health conditions](https://www.paho.org/en/ncds-and-covid-19) have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms or dying of COVID-19. The pandemic has put the issue of health inequities and access gaps to quality care into sharp relief, as NCDs tend to be more prevalent in the lower socio-economic groups.  

In this context of uncontrolled related risk factors and scarce doctors, having a well-trained and adequately large nursing workforce is crucial. With these principles in mind and the purpose of shaping a more resilient health system, the UKaid-funded [Better Health Programme Mexico (BHPMx)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mexico-prosperity-fund-better-health-programme) designed a comprehensive strategy and plan of action to foster the advanced nursing practice in Mexico. 





The strategy considers four main pillars:  

* Diagnosis and planning 
* Knowledge exchange 
* Education and training  
* Advocacy and communication 

Nursing and midwifery cadres are essential to achieving quality universal healthcare.  Nurses and midwives are predominantly women, and it is essential that we promote income earning, power, and agency—as well as strive to make midwifery an accredited career option for secure employment. A cross-cutting emphasis on gender equality and social inclusion has been considered within these four policy pathways. 

The Mexican health sector has wanted to expand the advanced practice nurse (APN) role for some years, but in practice, there are currently very few qualified APNs at work in Mexico. An APN role enables task shifting, reduces the pressure on doctors and costs for the health system, while increasing the career options for nurses. The COVID-19 pandemic brought the need for the APN role into sharp focus. With so many people hospitalised with acute disease related to the coronavirus, there is a clear need for more nurses with advanced treatment skills.

## Workflow Diagnosis and Planning

In 2020, BHPMx began working with the National School of Nursing and Obstetrics (ENEO) to research the barriers to expanding the APN role in Mexico. ENEO teamed up with researchers and students at the prestigious Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), and the resulting research was used in a comparative analysis of the APN role in the United Kingdom and Mexico. This gap analysis also provided a mapping of the constraints and opportunities facing Mexico, generating helpful data to enable the design of a future national policy on the APN role.  

A collaborative approach among all health professionals must occur to assure the best possible outcomes for both short and long-term perspectives, and BHPMx brokered the support from the  UK NHS Joint Unit, Health Education England, and the  General Medical Council, to identify UK experts who could share their experience and provide feedback on the research design and policy recommendations.  

"We are very proud to be involved in an international project within the Better Health Program," said Rosa Zárate, Director of the National School of Nursing and Obstetrics, ENEO. "It is an excellent learning opportunity between Mexico and the United Kingdom to contribute to the expansion of the role of nursing in our country and to start training a new generation of researchers." 

This productive engagement has also led to the participation of the BHPMx team in the Mexican Secretariat of Health Strategic Group, the technical group that is contributing to the drafting of the National Plan, which contains the main guidelines and standards for the advanced nursing practice strategy's rollout in every Mexican state.

## Education and Training

Our partners UNAM, [TecSalud](https://www.tecsalud.mx/), and [Primary Care International](https://pci-360.com/) have developed e-learning modules on leadership, teamwork, and digital skills, which will be available this year for all health professionals in Mexico.  

Similarly, a self-directed diploma in nursing comprehensive care in diabetes with a primary healthcare approach will be delivered to thousands of practising professional nurses thanks to the synergies encouraged by BHPMx.  

In addition, nursing and medicine undergraduate and graduate programmes are being reviewed to enhance interprofessional training and promote a more equitable health workforce framework.  

Furthermore, a healthcare model based on advanced nursing practices is scheduled to be piloted in the poorer southern state of Chiapas this year. This will generate the practical evidence needed in a low resource setting to scale the model to a national level eventually. 

Through a partnership approach, BHPMx has linked high-level representatives of the government, academia, nongovernmental groups, regulatory bodies, and international organisations. A communication and advocacy campaign will supplement efforts to increase awareness of the relevance of the advanced nursing practice within the health system.  

The empowerment of nurses within the Mexican health care system is perhaps the most representative example of how BHPMx is simultaneously helping to improve access to quality of care and promote gender equity while building a sustainable UK-Mexico collaboration agenda for better health. The programme aims to raise the profile and status of nursing in Mexico, for years overlooked, as well as creating a meaningful career path and therefore more opportunity for social mobility, as well as plugging gaps in vital primary care services.
