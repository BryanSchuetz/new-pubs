During the COVID-19 health crisis, land might not appear to be an urgent issue. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the pandemic is more than a health emergency—it’s an economic and social emergency too, which threatens to worsen the economic outlook for many people who are already extremely vulnerable. We know those most at risk, in Ethiopia and worldwide, are those without equity—and by improving land rights for these people, we can help to empower them and reduce their risk.






In this article, we examine the impact COVID-19 is already having on land rights and by extension on empowerment, economic growth, and food security objectives in Ethiopia. In the longer term, it is imperative to support regional and municipal authorities to deal with the practicalities of land administration as part of the broader COVID-19 response.

### Evidence from the Field 

DAI has been implementing the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)-funded [Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-land-investment-transformation-lift) programme in Ethiopia since 2013. The programme focuses primarily on securing the land rights of smallholder farmers across four highland regions, with 14 million parcels approved to date. LIFT also works closely with the Government of Ethiopia to increase the capacity of land administration systems and services to record these land rights and provide additional services to claimants. Beyond building the capacity of the systems and services to deliver and protect land rights, LIFT also works with banks, microfinance institutions (MFIs), and agricultural input suppliers to help farmers with land titles access finance, formalise rental agreements, and improve productivity. 

LIFT is already experiencing direct and indirect effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Predictably, the introduction of social distancing and other measures has slowed down the operation of the programme, but beyond this effect, we are also seeing reduced land administration services, changing farmer behaviour, and a potential reduction in land productivity. 

### Reduced Capacity of Land Administration Leads to Reduced Tenure Security 

LIFT’s registration efforts are highly participatory. They include raising awareness around land issues, public displays of maps and boundaries, and certificate distribution events that draw large numbers of people. These activities have been paused for public health reasons [since April 8.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/ethiopia-declares-state-emergency-fight-covid-19-200408142519485.html) Furthermore, when demarcating land parcels, field teams work closely with farmers and their neighbours to identify plots accurately. Pausing registration activities indefinitely means farmers will not have their land rights recorded and recognised, which may lead to reduced tenure security for individuals at a time when tenure security risks may be heightened. Early evidence suggests a fall in land authorities’ capacity to respond to claims and queries, leading to gaps in service.
