[*Half*](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/640121513095868125/pdf/122029-WP-REVISED-PUBLIC.pdf) the world’s 7 billion people lack access to essential health services. That’s a terrible number, and yet an enormous market opportunity. The kind of opportunity that might pique the interest of mobile tech entrepreneurs who note that while many of these underserved people lack healthcare, they nonetheless tend to have mobile phones and some internet access—even those who live in remote locales.

IntraHealth International created the [SwitchPoint](https://event.switchpointideas.com/) conference to juxtapose and address opportunities like these. An eclectic, two-day gathering—primarily but not exclusively of global health and digital practitioners—the eighth annual SwitchPoint went off last week. Some 400 attendees brought to the Saxapahaw, North Carolina festival a deep reservoir experience, fresh ideas, and no little energy. But they would be the first to admit that none has the total package of resources required to address market opportunities at scale in health services delivery. 

For that, the right people need to join forces, which is why SwitchPoint exists. 
 
“Across the world, most people have a phone before they have electricity, so why not use mobile phones to deliver healthcare?” noted [ClickMedix](https://clickmedix.com/) founder and CEO Ting Shih, one of the SwitchPoint participants. More on her later.

Development funders such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are urging new players to the table in their bids to meet basic healthcare and other needs. These invitations are extended for humanitarian ends, but in the knowledge that corporations and social entrepreneurs—for-profit and nonprofit alike—need both to generate and earn value if they are to win an enduring place in the global health ecosystem.

“If we are creating value for society, we are going to be viable,” said [Chris LeGrand](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/leadership/christopher-legrand), who moderated a SwitchPoint microlab on “Creative Public-Private Partnerships and Alliances: New Models for Catalyzing Impact.” Legrand is the President of [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) and a longtime health services entrepreneur. “We are not talking about traditional corporate social responsibility outlays,” he said, “but creating common value for all involved.”

## Reconciling “Me” and “We”

The microlab tackled one the key challenges in any PPP—“the right people joining forces.” Its participants were given a hypothetical challenge: cut maternal and infant mortality and malnutrition in a developing country with elevated birth rates. After splitting into teams, each team designated four parties—an investor, a social entrepreneur, a development organization, and a host government—to come to a meeting of minds on how to scale a solution.

“Each of four actors has to create value that none was going to create on its own,” said LeGrand, who moderated the session along with Shih, IntraHealth Senior Vice President [Rebecca Kohler](https://www.intrahealth.org/people/rebecca-kohler), and [Malcom Riley](https://globalhealth-staging.globalhealth.duke.edu/people/staff/malcom-riley) of the Duke University Global Health Institute.

Microlab participants described the roadblocks they encountered in the course of the thought experiment. One team’s notional investor—a gold mining company—was only interested in funding work in its area of operations. Another team’s host government, apparently known for corruption, insisted on controlling the partnership yet promised accountability. A third team surmised that local culture encouraged large families, raising questions about the efficacy of family planning assistance.

Competing interests and incentives, mistrust, and an unclear grasp of mission marked the exercise. If the other parties in a development enterprise negotiation are arguing over “what‘s in it for me,” what investor would want to dive into that? Riley, who manages health partnerships for Duke, observed: “If a corporation does not like the value proposition, if it cannot add value to the corporate arm, the money will end.”

## Partnering to Influence Health Outcomes

Motivated by the global growth of mobile technology and a goal to deliver health care services “to 1 billion people,” Shih founded ClickMedix in 2010. The company is now active in 21 countries. ClickMedix offers an mHealth platform that enables customers—hospitals, doctors, pharmacists, insurers, government funders of health services—to serve hard-to-reach patients via mobile devices.

Shih aspires to grow ClickMedix into a global “Amazon for healthcare” that enables click-of-a-button transactions between the myriad actors that comprise a country’s healthcare delivery network—connecting doctors in cities to nurses in communities to patients in remote locales, and all the suppliers, providers, and payers along the way.

“The proliferation of mobile devices adopted worldwide means that we can now make healthcare accessible and affordable to millions more people,” Shih said.

DAI Global Health and ClickMedix first connected in 2016 through the [Innovation into Action Challenge](https://www.dai.com/news/innovation-action-challenge-winners-chosen), a competition to surface innovative, demand-driven ideas, products, and services. Recently, DAI [announced](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-global-health-invests-in-mhealth-leader-clickmedix) a strategic investment in ClickMedix, which joins mobile pediatrics specialists [THINKMD](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-invests-in-thinkmds-clinical-assessment-technology), mobile medical optics firm [MobileODT](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-invests-in-mobileodt-a-breakthrough-provider-of-cervical-cancer-detection-tech), and [IntraHealth](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-intrahealth-join-forces-to-amplify-global-health-impact) as networked partners of DAI Global Health.

“DAI is going through a series of different kinds of relationships,” LeGrand said. “These are not controlling relationships—for example, we invest in Ting, but we don’t control her. We are building a ‘neural network’ and relationships that will create positive influences in global healthcare delivery.”

## “Cool-Headed, Even Cold-Hearted”

In gathering together creative people from across disciplines, SwitchPoint aspires to help them turn their big concepts into workable models. This year, that process included frank talk on cost vs. benefit and the laws of supply and demand. “We have to be cool-headed, even cold-hearted about innovation and resist being blinded by wonderful ideas,” cautioned [Dai Hozumi](https://www.intrahealth.org/people/dai-hozumi), IntraHealth’s Chief Technical Officer, in a well-received presentation on the perils of innovation absent business savvy.

ClickMedix seems to have embraced that ethos. Its customers—in both developing and developed countries—have bought into the platform because at the end of the day it helps them reach more patients. “It’s not donor driven, it’s demand driven,” LeGrand said. “We think it’s a more sustainable model.”
