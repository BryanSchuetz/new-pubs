# Introduction to InovAgro

Innovations for Agribusiness (InovAgro) is the first market systems development project in Mozambique. Funded by the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) and active in 11 districts in three northern provinces, the project—a private sector-led agriculture growth initiative that partners with companies seeking to engage with smallholder farmers—has since evolved to include a successful intervention that assists farmers to save for the purchase of high-quality seeds and other agricultural inputs through community-based savings groups. This paper looks at the factors behind that success and the prognostics for the future.  









Since 2011, InovAgro has introduced various initiatives to stimulate private sector engagement with smallholder farmers. The project chose Mozambique’s seed sector as its main point of leverage because poor use of certified seeds was one of the biggest factors suppressing agricultural productivity.  InovAgro established strong relationships with leading seed companies to help them demonstrate the value of high-quality seeds and good agricultural practices to smallholders, aiming to build demand in this market. 

However, farmers in Mozambique often struggle to afford seeds, other inputs, and labor at planting time. In July 2015, InovAgro launched a new intervention—the Fundo Agricola (FA)—to expand farmers’ capacity to save for seeds and other agricultural inputs by leveraging Mozambique’s existing village savings and loan associations (VSLAs). The FA provided a system for farmers to save in advance for the inputs they need to purchase at the beginning of each planting season. 

Over the first four years of the intervention, more than 12,500 farmers participated in the program and saved increasing amounts each year. This number increased by 5,348 new savers in 2019, bringing the total to 17,445. In the 2018-19 planting season, farmers saved the equivalent of US$135,000 to help them pay for a range of inputs—from seeds and fertilizers to labor, which then increased to $257,800 in 2019. In 2018, they spent $59,650 on certified seeds alone which increased to $140,000  in 2019. Both numbers of participants and the amount saved per person grew each year (Figure 1).
