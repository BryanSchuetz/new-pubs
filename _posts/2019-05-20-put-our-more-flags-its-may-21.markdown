Every year on this day, May 21, the United Nations celebrates what it calls the [World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development](https://www.un.org/en/events/culturaldiversityday/index.shtml).

“Cultural diversity,” says the UN, “is a driving force of development, not only with respect to economic growth, but also as a means of leading a more fulfilling intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual life.”

At DAI, we have never made much of this day. Perhaps we have been complacent. After all, we tell ourselves, we already uphold “global citizenship” as one of our four [cardinal values](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/mission-and-values), alongside integrity, responsibility, and excellence.
 
But this year, at a time when demagogues the world over have found renewed license to demean other cultures and people of all faiths have found themselves under attack for their beliefs and cultural practices, it seems fitting to mark a day like May 21.

What do we mean by global citizenship? Here’s the full text from our values statement:

> We are a global company with a global outlook. We depend on our diversity, respect the cultures in which we work, and treat everyone, everywhere with professionalism and dignity. We thrive on collaboration with our partners around the world, and share with them the hope that our work will leave the world a better place.

Part of me would like to leave it there. But let me flesh out just a little why we include these beliefs in our charter.
