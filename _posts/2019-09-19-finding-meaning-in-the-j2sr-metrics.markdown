How can national-level indicators be best used to inform the debate around a given country’s development challenges? It’s a question many of us are asking following the release of the Journey to Self-Reliance (J2SR) Primary Metrics—17 cross-country metrics that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has established to measure a country’s progress on economic growth, democratic governance, civil society capacity, and other aspects of development. 

While USAID is still working through how these metrics will be used, its intention is to use them “to define country roadmaps”—which chart where a country stands in its journey to self-reliance and how it might get there.

National-level metrics are useful when they afford a common language for development practitioners to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of countries. They become counterproductive when overzealous conclusions are made based solely on viewing a set of country rankings, as the Agency is careful to warn against. Complementing the J2SR metrics with rigorous descriptive methods of analysis can help avoid this trap, provide potentially useful insights, and provoke new questions as to how certain policies and programs may fail or succeed in a given country. 

Seeking to illuminate how we think about the data that make up country roadmaps, this article has three parts: 

* An overview of the J2SR metrics, their core components, and how USAID has categorized 
* A brief discussion of the limitations inherent in any metric-based cross-country analysis—to which J2SR is no exception—highlighting issues such as subnational variance, lack of uniformity in measurement, and the challenges of asserting external validity or assigning causality. 
* Finally, five examples illustrating approaches that policy makers and development practitioners might employ to ask more refined questions of the J2SR metrics and what may or may not work on a policy or programmatic level.
