**Because who needs pharmaceutical drugs when you can just implant a shape-memory polymer with an embedded circuit to send neuro-signals to your faulty organs?**

<br>

# 1) A direct line to your liver:
Bioelectronics is a field poised to change medicine. How do they work? Well, all you have to do is print a nano-scale electronic circuit onto a polymer material that is human-tissue-like enough that your body won’t trigger its natural defense mechanism of rejecting all foreign objects. Then you have to take the neuro-signal patterns from the brain and program the circuits to mimic those neuro-signals. Then, adhere the polymer directly to the malfunctioning tissue and it will deliver brain-like signals straight to the organ. That silly broken liver won’t know the difference!

### Simple, right?

### Yeah sounds simple enough, so what do these shape-memory-polymers look like?

# 2)	Waaay better then traditional drugs
Bioelectronics are better, more precise, and come with fewer side effects than our decades old (like 15 decades old) pharmaceutical-based system of drug delivery. At SXSW there was a great panel moderated by [Sree Sreenivasan](https://twitter.com/sree) with several of the rock star pioneers working in the field: 

* Dr. Moncef Slaoui was among the developers of the first malaria vaccine and has recently turned his attention to bioelectronics. 

* Dr. Kate Rosenbluth is the CEO of Cala Health, a company working on developing novel therapies from recent discoveries in neuroscience. 

* Dr. Walter Voit is a professor at UT Dallas and is devoted to growing a core of scientists specializing in this field. 

Their enthusiasm for improving medicine was palpable (because they've been working in the field their entire lives) and it was inspiring to hear from technologists that were in it for so much more than a big exit from a well funded startup.

# 3) Neurosignaling and facial-nervous stimulation are here
Just strap one of these devices to your head and walk cooly and confidently (and stimulatedly) into your next meeting or happy hour. From your smartphone you get to select from categories of feelings like calm, energy, or focus. The Washington Post [just recently reviewed the devices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/03/29/brain-zapping-gadgets-promise-to-make-you-a-better-you-smarter-stronger-even-happier/) made by [Thync](http://www.thync.com/)

# 4)	DIY Brainsignaling
Open Source Neurostimulation software and hardware is so advanced that you can self –administer the technology in your own home. Why limit ourselves to thermometer sensors and rain gauges of the maker movement when we could jump straight to the Brain Computer Interface  movement and build neuro-stimulating machines from the comfort of our own garages. Disclaimer: DAI makes no recommendation towards self administration of neuro-stimulation– it is not a well understood field
