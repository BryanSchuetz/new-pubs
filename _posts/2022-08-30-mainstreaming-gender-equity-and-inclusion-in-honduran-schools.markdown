Persistently high levels of violence in Honduras drive irregular out-migration, with harmful consequences for young Hondurans. When parents leave the country without their children, the resulting family disintegration leaves young people even more vulnerable to gangs and violence, which often bleeds onto school campuses and [impedes learning](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_Honduras_CDCS_Public_Version_CLEAN_b.pdf) for all students. Unfortunately, many schools lack the resources and training to implement violence prevention activities that would support vulnerable youth and improve enrollment and retention. 

The U.S. Agency for International Development’s [School-Based Violence Prevention Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-securing-education), known locally as *Asegurando la Educación*, is led by DAI in 200 schools from 11 cities across Honduras. Our work helps students feel safer in their schools so they can commit to their education, graduate, and pursue careers in their communities, rather than migrating. *Asegurando* engages with educators, students, families, government authorities, and community actors to strengthen safe, inclusive learning spaces while building institutional capacity to sustain these efforts.

Honduras has the [highest femicide rate](https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/violence-against-women-other-pandemic-impacting-honduras#:~:text=Honduras%20has%20the%20highest%20femicide%20rate%20in%20the%20Latin%20American,have%20lost%20their%20lives%20violently) in Latin America and young women and girls especially experience high rates of physical and emotional violence. Accordingly, *Asegurando* integrates a gender and social inclusion (GESI) lens in all its activities. Raising awareness, mainstreaming gender topics—including roles and stereotypes—and addressing social perceptions of equity and inclusion are all contributing elements of [gender-based violence prevention](https://www.coe.int/en/web/gender-matters). When combined with efforts to promote social-emotional learning, well-being, and psychosocial support, GESI themes contribute to safer learning spaces, which support improved academic performance, retention, and graduation rates. 

The following examples illustrate how *Asegurando* helps to prevent gender-based violence in schools by integrating equity and inclusion into its interventions. 

## Changing Community Perceptions

In Honduras, especially in poorer communities, rigid social norms adversely affect both men and women. According to the United Nations, women and girls spend an average of 17.3 percent of their time on unpaid care and domestic work, compared to 4.3 percent spent by their male counterparts. This burden can interfere with a girl’s education and career prospects, leading to economic dependence.

“A lot of women and girls have grown up [being told], you are a woman, you have to do this, you have to do the washing, you have to iron, you have to cook,” as one student from La Ceiba put it. On the other hand, men and boys in Honduras are often conditioned to believe they must be strong providers who lead households in an authoritarian manner, based on fear. They must always present themselves as strong and are told not to cry or express emotions. For male students, this can make it even more difficult to deal with challenging situations and find healthy outlets for emotions and trauma without turning to violence. 

*Asegurando* facilitates programs for the school community to encourage positive change. All of the social-emotional learning (SEL) programs, such as [Influencer 504](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMDqmGBWgFM&list=PLUkTqAE0ApJU9hhFmMV6PlH9UiAEw0OQ7) and [School-for-Parents](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkTqAE0ApJU4f3TpAqAqjjqCJ7QpxH3D), promote GESI by discussing domestic roles and responsibilities and focusing on issues of equity, equality, empathy, and respect, to name a few examples. *Asegurando* also supports school leaders and School Community Committees—parent-teacher-student groups that analyze problems in their schools and design solutions to strengthen safe learning spaces. Committee members participate in training sessions that emphasize equal gender roles, social inclusion, and gender-based violence prevention. Student leaders become peer educators by sharing with their classmates what they have learned. The students also use the violence-meter (*violentómetro*), a thermometer-like visual that helps raise awareness of preventing violence in relationships. 

According to 10th grader Zenia Amaya, who became the first female president at her male-dominated school, normalizing GESI and openly discussing equitable gender roles and respect in schools makes a huge difference. Young women and girls “can see the change and instead of migrating, we can stand up for our rights,” she said. 

“By teaching our students about the important role women play…they respond with their support so that each student (boys and girls) will be represented in decision-making spaces,” said Melvin Lago, a teacher at the German Technical Center Institute of Honduras.
