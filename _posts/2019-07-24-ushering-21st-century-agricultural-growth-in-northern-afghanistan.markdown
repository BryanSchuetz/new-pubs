Recent decades of drought and conflict sent Afghanistan’s wheat production into sharp decline. Irrigation systems and farm equipment fell into disrepair or were destroyed and farmers were forced to abandon their land. In a country where the poor subsist largely on bread and tea, the decline of its fundamental farm crop led to major losses of livelihoods but also of domestically grown food. Formerly productive communities came to depend on *imported* wheat and flour.

In 2014, the Regional Agricultural Development Program–North (RADP-North) launched with a threefold mission: 1) rebuild Afghanistan’s wheat sector in six northern provinces, 2) diversify agriculture and diets and increase farm revenues by introducing high-value crops, and 3) strengthen the underperforming livestock sector.

Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, RADP-North worked with local farmers, businesses, and leaders to produce impressive results over its recent five-year run, including:

* **$256 million in additional sales** in wheat and other RADP-North targeted commodities.
* **$28 million of confirmed sales and $20 million in follow-up orders** for dried fruit and nuts through beneficiaries’ attendance at trade shows.
* **$8.3 million in increased profits** by partner agribusinesses.
* **$10.7 million in increased value** of livestock through reduced mortality, increased reproduction, and increased sale of animal by-products.
* **Nearly 20,000 women trained in nutrition** and more than 7,700 kitchen gardens supported, empowering women to improve household nutrition, disseminate nutrition principles, reduce child diarrhea, and prevent anemia.

The only USAID project headquartered in Afghanistan’s northern economic hub of Mazar-i-Sharif, RADP-North worked with partner provinces Badakhshan, Baghlan, Balkh, Jawzjan, Kunduz, and Samangan, home to 5 million people. Its resuscitation of the north's agriculture economy succeeded in generating incomes, spinoff jobs, and spending money for farm families and the business operators among them.

## Restoring the Breadbasket

RADP-North identified key barriers to the wheat sector’s growth:

* A lack of agricultural services throughout the wheat value chain; 
* Weak input supply chains; and
* Inefficient, labor-intensive crop production.

RADP-North modernized the sector through market-led systemic improvements targeting soil, seed, and harvest. The project team implemented a program of conservation agriculture and introduced laser land-leveling, mechanized seeding, and mechanical harvesting.

**Laser land-leveling:** The project facilitated cost-share purchases of 35 laser-assisted land-leveling units by local service providers. Once trained, these vendors sold their services to farmers, who benefited from more balanced water dispersion and reduced cost to irrigate and fertilize. RADP-North facilitated the leveler supply chain—from the fabricators in Pakistan to the farmers purchasing the services—giving birth to a sector of equipment dealers and trained mechanics.  

A single season of land leveling increased wheat yields and led to further mechanized operations, including for seeding and reaping. Leveling services are now being readily adopted as both farmers and service providers are profiting.

**Introducing better seed:** RADP-North organized field demonstrations by seed purveyors of 20 certified varieties, showing farmers they could choose seed that best fit their growing conditions and budgets. Farmers’ confidence in certified seed was deemed crucial because seed proliferation in Afghanistan had been adulterated by large distribution programs that did not accommodate soil, climate, and market requirements.

Additional farmers learned of certified seed through word of mouth, and RADP-North trained seed company field staff in marketing techniques such as field demos. Today, at least 10 seed businesses are connected with RADP-North farmers and better understand the market’s requirements.

**Efficient seeding:** Tractor-drawn seeders seed and fertilize leveled land quickly and evenly, reducing waste, improving spacing between plants, and reducing crop competition with weeds. RADP-North helped vendors obtain 39 new tractor-seeder units through cost-share purchases plus 30 used units, with vendors then marketing their services to farmers. Mechanized seeding bolstered the input services supply chain, including for repair and maintenance of seeders.

**Harvesting profits:** Manual harvesting can comprise 30 percent of a farmer’s production costs. RADP-North facilitated contracted harvesting by: (1) mobilizing unused two-wheeled tractors and reaper equipment; (2) establishing equipment owners as service contractors; (3) helping aspiring contractors to procure new equipment; (4) linking harvesting contractors to local mechanic workshops for service; (5) demonstrating harvesting technology for farmers at field days; and (6) linking harvesters with farmers.

## Diversifying Farms

RADP-North targeted sectors ripe for export, including orchards (apricot and almond), vineyards (grapes and raisins) and melons. Five dried fruit and nut agribusinesses assisted by RADP-North generated confirmed sales of $28 million and follow-up orders of $20 million through attendance at trade shows in India, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China. Follow-up sales indicated the buyers’ needs were met by the supplier on previous orders.

Many Afghans suffer from chronic undernutrition, often because they lack information about nutrition. RADP-North taught basic nutrition and helped women establish vegetable gardens in their yards, helping them to:

* Grow healthy seasonally fresh vegetables;
* Save money by growing vegetables and herbs instead of purchasing them;
* Increase incomes through surplus vegetables and herb sales;
* Recycle and reuse household waste resources such as sweepings, kitchen scraps, and dirty garden water; and
* Employ uncultivated land around houses for productive purposes.

Nearly all women were maintaining their gardens as RADP-North ended, with some cultivating seasonal vegetables by purchasing their own seed or using seed saved from the previous crop season.

Women reported serving their families a more diverse diet while finding kitchen gardening enjoyable. Husbands expressed gratitude and many families sent their children to school with the required books and pens due to selling excess produce. Support by community elders, husbands, and brothers are helping to assure sustainability, as will, we suspect, the improved cognitive capabilities of infants and toddlers during the first critical 1,000 days of life where nutrition has significant impacts.

## Healthy Livestock, Healthy Profits

RADP-North identified major bottlenecks to improving animal health and feed—deficiencies tied to goat and sheep mortality, reproductivity, weight gain, sales value, and disease resistance. The project implemented initiatives to improve animal diets, veterinary treatment, and the quality of butcher shops.

Winter feeding and veterinary field programs combined to reduce mortality loss by an estimated 25 percent (from $18.24 million to $13.68 million). Along with gains resulting from increased reproduction ($6.17 million) and increased sale of animal by-products ($48,450), RADP-North’s livestock activity delivered a $10.78 million increase for the northern economy.

## Treat Farms as Businesses

Laser land leveling and conservation agriculture offer gateways to further agricultural development, including through mechanization and other efficient technologies. The RADP-North team learned much about introducing and upscaling laser land-leveling and other next steps in advanced production. 

RADP-North also helped jumpstart the wheat trade by hosting business-to-business events to show producers, processers, wholesalers, and retailers that Afghan wheat can compete with imports to meet the needs of bakers and pasta makers. These introductory events produced transactions for 835 tons of wheat and flour over 46 contracts.

Instead of focusing on a value chain such as wheat, future assistance should shift toward developing farm systems and introducing profit-generating technologies. By treating the farm as a business with investment options, and farmers as businessmen balancing risk and reward, and recognizing that rotational crops and other conservation approaches can improve and sustain crop productivity, projects can deliver broader economic growth and nutrition outcomes. There is much value to be realized through under-invested crops indigenous to Afghanistan that have a history of export, including mungbean and sesame—both of which the regional market strongly demands—high-margin oilseeds, and pulses.

The RADP-North project generated impressive results and value. But its most impressive achievement might be unveiling many opportunities to make Afghanistan’s agricultural economy more resilient, inclusive, and profitable for generations to come.
