*In 2021, DAI introduced the Awesomeness Fund, an internal competition for funding for innovative ideas. Seventeen technical teams across the company took on the challenge; six were successful and spent half the year working to pilot their solutions. [Kimberly Keeton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlyekeeton/), a communications specialist at DAI, sat down with [Rhi Gulick](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/rhiannon-gulick), a technical expert in natural resource management, energy, and climate change. Gulick and her teammates created a municipal climate adaptation tool, or MuniCAT.* 


 


**Q: What is MuniCAT?** 

“MuniCAT is a benchmarking tool, piloted in Excel, that helps local governments consolidate, understand, and apply information about climate change into better action on the ground. It helps them understand the skills and capacities they need to contribute to national adaptation efforts and support their own constituents and communities. By measuring these capacities, MuniCAT helps local governments understand not only what kind of skills they need to support adaptation, but also to identify where their capacity falls short, and where external support or other resources can be most effective at supporting adaptation.” 

 

What drove you to co-develop a tool like this?  

 

“DAI has an internal fund for interesting technical ideas from staff. Our Natural Resources Management (NRM) team brainstormed some ideas, and I came up with an idea to help translate all the information that local governments have about climate change into better action on the ground. Originally, I thought it would be more closely linked to a vulnerability assessment, but we realized that there are enough tools out there to identify vulnerabilities; the challenge is understanding not just how to address them, but what kind of skills government might need to do that effectively. 

 

“I worked closely with a few colleagues—Shannon Vasamsetti from the Climate Change and NRM team, and Colin McCabe from the Governance team—to develop the framework for the tool. We then held a set of co-creation sessions to refine it, and engaged with one of DAI’s projects in Guatemala, USAID Nexos Locales, to update the tool for the Guatemalan context and pilot it on the ground.”  

 

What gap does MuniCAT fill?  

 

“There are so many tools out there about climate adaptation - 

Community-level planning tools for resilience to help households better prepare for climate-related shocks and stresses;  

Hazard maps and vulnerability assessments that highlight key climate risks, where they are most likely to have an impact, and which groups are likely to be disproportionally affected;  

Adaptation plans; and 

There are even national-scale and community-level adaptive capacity frameworks that highlight the broad-scale strategic planning and prioritization capacities that a country or a community needs to develop long-term, high-level climate adaptation plans and policies.  

 

“What’s missing is a tool that helps municipal governments—the “middle” layer between national planning and community action—understand which skills and capacities they need to contribute to national adaptation efforts and support their own constituents and communities. A municipal government not only needs to deliver high-quality services, but it needs to have additional core capacities that will allow it to adapt those services in the face of climate change. In many countries, it is this subnational government level where the rubber of adaptation planning meets the road.  

 

“MuniCAT aims to help fill this “missing middle” by collaborating with municipal government to benchmark their skills and capacities against core adaptive capacity needs. These capacity needs include things, like long-term planning and adaptive management; mobilizing resources to support adaptation—whether by supporting more resilient local resource mobilization or accessing external funding for adaptation; understanding climate information and potential impacts, and using that information to develop implementable adaptation actions that increase climate resiliency and support development; and lastly, engaging municipal officials, staff, and citizens to bolster support for adaptation.” 

 

What early results have you already seen from the tool?  

 

“The Nexos Locales team found the tool to be useful in understanding where their partner municipalities need capacity support, and there is interest within the team to expand its use beyond the pilot next year. We are also looking at opportunities to adapt and test it in Honduras, as well as some other countries. In addition to being a useful tool in the climate change space, we also designed it to ‘nest’ into some of DAI’s existing governance tools, such as the municipal performance index (link?), so that we can have a concrete way to integrate adaptive capacity into broader municipal governance programming.” 

  

How would you like to see MuniCAT used in the near- and long-term?  

 

“I would love to see MuniCAT used more widely. I think there is real potential to use it to make the support we give municipalities more relevant and more helpful. I also think there is a real opportunity to link together some of the work we have been doing in the climate space with the work we do in governance, and hopefully increase the impact of both.”
