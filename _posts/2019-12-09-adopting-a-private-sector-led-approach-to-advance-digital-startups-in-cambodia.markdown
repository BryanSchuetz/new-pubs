Years of working side-by-side with Cambodians in the civic technology sector taught us many things about the country’s startup scene. Its denizens are smart and passionate about their work. Many have their finger on the pulse of what communities want and need. So, what’s missing? Why aren’t there more internationally known Cambodian firms?

The answer is that the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Cambodia needs support at the critical growth stage to help pull fledgling enterprises rise out of the startup phase and enable their transformation into mature job- and wealth-creating businesses. 





According to [2018 research](https://www.raintreecambodia.com/research) from Raintree and Mekong Strategic Partners, there are now roughly 300 startups in Cambodia. As documented in [recent reports](https://www.khmertimeskh.com/597071/cambodia-launches-its-first-technology-startup-report/), “What was once a relatively quiet ecosystem has really burst into life in the last few years.” But wide gaps still exist between promising startups and the investments that will facilitate their maturation.

The DAI-led [Development Innovations (DI)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), highlighted this gap in a 2018 report on the sector: “Startups are not widely ready for investments. The majority of startups are [stuck] in pre-seed or seed stage.” DI’s goal was to boost civil society’s access to and use of tools such as [mobile technologies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuawilwohl/2016/02/14/new-app-to-help-cambodians-track-complaints-made-with-local-govt/#589cafd3156f), the Internet, and social media. But that objective is incomplete—and unsustainable—if tech firms can’t extend their reach beyond the early stages.

We knew support for growth-stage startups would fill a key gap in Cambodia’s startup ecosystem. We knew we needed a new model. 

### Bring in the Private Sector

A solution came in the form of a partnership with the private sector. In June 2018, DI designed a call for proposals for venture capital firms that want to help Cambodian startups become investment-ready opportunities. DI ultimately selected an investment and advisory services firm called [Mekong Strategic Partners (MSP)](http://www.mekongstrategic.com/) to design and manage the accelerator based on its expertise in the financial and startup services sector in Cambodia and the greater Mekong region. MSP, collaborating with [Seedstars](https://www.seedstars.com/), a Swiss organization, jumped into the design phase of the accelerator program.

Simultaneously, [Smart Axiata](https://www.smart.com.kh/)—a major mobile network operator in Cambodia and a long-time DI partner—signed on as a co-sponsor because it recognizes the value of an investor-led accelerator focusing on high-potential firms. It was especially interested in building a pipeline of more investible businesses for the [Smart Axiata Digital Innovations Fund](https://sadif.com.kh/), a $5 million venture capital fund managed by MSP. The final accelerator design leveraged Seedstars’ tried-and-tested investment readiness program for startups with a strong focus on local and regional mentorship, tailored to the needs of maturing Cambodian startups.

The resulting SmartScale, powered by Seedstars accelerator, kicked off in April 2019. For the intensive three-month program, MSP and Seedstars selected 11 businesses, all of which had a product or products at the “minimum viable product” stage or better. These businesses—four of which are led by women—came from a range of sectors, including logistics, healthcare, ecotourism, and job placement services. In an interesting twist, two of the startups were previous DI grantees—and one of those was designed with funds received from another USAID-funded project. 

Over the three months, each startup completed three bootcamps and several training sessions on topics such as lean startup principles, market validation, key performance indicators and experimentation, and customer activation and retention. Each learned conceptual and practical skills from local and international mentors and validated that their products or services are using sound, market-led principles. 

The accelerator culminated in a final demo day in July, where each company pitched in front of 100 members of the public, government representatives, local investors, and venture capital investors from Cambodia, Singapore, and Thailand. 

### What Did We Achieve?

Two of the 11 startups demonstrated true investment readiness, according to MSP’s investment scorecards. These startups are now in the due diligence phase with venture capital firms for potential funding. Three other startups are expected to reach investment readiness within three to six months and then enter the due diligence phase. Four more reported making connections with investors at the final demo day, which could lead to future investment discussions or business plan reviews, while others reported validating—or radically changing—their business models as a result of the accelerator. 

The results prove that investor-led approaches to growing the digital economy work in Cambodia; Cambodian businesses indeed possess the potential to attract local and international venture capital. Private and public funding options are readily available for accelerator or mentorship programs that get results for startups, or entrepreneurs in general. With the right amount of local context, tailored mentorship, and thoughtful, market-led approaches, private sector engagement multiplies the impact of donor funding.
