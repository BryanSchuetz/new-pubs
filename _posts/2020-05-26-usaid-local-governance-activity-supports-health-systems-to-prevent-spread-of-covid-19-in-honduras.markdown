The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Honduras Local Governance Activity (HLG), is supporting the prevention and early detection of COVID-19 in 41 municipalities, eight commonwealths, 18 nongovernment-managed health centers, six hospitals, four shelters for victims of gender-based violence, and seven youth groups in this Central American country of more than 9.6 million people.

Through the delivery of sanitation supplies and medical diagnostic tools, the Activity is working to improve the safety of more than 4,000 individuals who are actively responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in western Honduras. By strengthening local government and firstline health service provider capacity to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and detect potential cases at the local level, the Activity aims to indirectly benefit up to 1,119,954 people.

“We are very grateful. We did not have these kinds of supplies in the municipality. They will be very useful for the people who are working in health centers, checkpoints, and as volunteers,” said René Pérez, Mayor of San Andrés, Lempira. “On behalf of the people of San Andrés, thank you very much.”

Western Honduras, where our project works, suffers from weak public health systems and high levels of poverty, presenting complex challenges in addressing COVID-19. To date, there are 3,204 confirmed cases registered nationwide, and 156 people have died.

In April and May, approximately $126,000 worth of supplies—including more than 1,000 gallons each of bleach, hand sanitizer, detergent, and disinfectant—were delivered to the Dr. Enrique Aguilar Cerrato Hospital in Intibucá. The hospital, along with Juan Manuel Gálvez Hospital in Gracias, Lempira, both also received thermometers, pulse oximeters, and vital sign monitors to improve the care they provide to the people of Lempira and Intibucá. 

Additionally, the Activity staff equipped rural health providers in western Honduras, with digital thermometers and pulse oximeters to help detect early signs of COVID-19, refer patients to the specialized centers, and reduce contagion.

“This equipment is extremely important to provide quality care to COVID19 patients,” said Gracia Martínez, Director of the Juan Manuel Gálvez Hospital. “Sanitation supplies will allow us to disinfect isolation areas, which is vital for the prevention of more infections." 

“Our technicians are exposed due to the support we provide to the population and to the municipalities, these supplies help us to mitigate the risk of contagion in the provision of these important services,” added Ely Morales, manager of a municipal association.

The Activity has provided targeted technical assistance to increase transparency and improve the administrative management capacity of municipalities, municipal associations, and public service providers including decentralized health managers since 2017.

In addition to delivering supplies, the Activity is providing assistance to local governments and civil society organizations to bolster their efforts to implement the Solidaria strategy, and is also coordinating with decentralized health providers to support their work to prevent further spread of COVID-19.  

The Activity will continue collaborating with actors at the local level to attend the COVID-19 emergency. Next, the Activity will provide critical diagnostic and sanitation supplies to Health Sanitary Regions, Senior's Citizens Shelters and GVB Children Shelters, thanks to the rapid purchase mechanisms implemented by the Activity to cope the emergency.
