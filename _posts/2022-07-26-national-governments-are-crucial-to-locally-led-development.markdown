Global donors seeking to improve development results are increasingly looking to diversify their stable of partners and implementers as part of a broader drive toward locally led development. In 2021, for example, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power set out a new target for direct funding to local organizations, rising from 6 percent to 25 percent over the next four years. 

While the role of civil society organizations, local research institutions, the private sector, and other actors should indeed be amplified in the push for localization, international donors also recognize that national governments are critical to locally led development. USAID is working to “[redefine their relationship](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/LCD_Policy_-_FORMATTED_508_01-11.pdf)” with partner governments and help develop their capacity; similarly, the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) recognizes the importance of engaging national governments to [Health-Systems-Strengthening-Position-Paper.pdf](/uploads/Health-Systems-Strengthening-Position-Paper.pdf). 






Working with national governments in this way requires effective tools and methodologies to assess government systems’ readiness and strengthen government capacity. In this article, we look at the critical factors for successfully engaging governments as partners.

## Effective Engagement  

Direct investment in government places funding closer to those with the potential to benefit most and—if done properly—has the potential to strengthen government service delivery systems. But with increased scrutiny on aid spending, development agencies wary of the scope for waste or even corruption are sometimes dissuaded from using country systems to manage funding. However, several mechanisms have emerged to mitigate the risks of direct investment in counterpart governments.
