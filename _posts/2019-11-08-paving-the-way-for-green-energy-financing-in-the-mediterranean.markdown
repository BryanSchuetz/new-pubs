In the face of a gathering climate crisis, “The world must quickly implement massive energy efficiency and conservation practices,” declared more than 11,000 climate scientists in a statement issued November 5. Their warning lends added urgency to a program that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has been running for more than a decade, and which is now poised to expand in North Africa.

In 2006, the EBRD launched Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities (SEFFs) as part of its Sustainable Energy Initiative. Through these facilities, the bank provides credit lines to financial institutions, which in turn enables them to lend money on to their business clients for investment in energy-efficiency projects.

Since 2006, the EBRD has launched such facilities in 22 countries to encourage businesses and individuals to invest in green and renewable energy—leading to positive financial and environmental outcomes for businesses, residents, and communities. 

DAI’s first experience managing an EBRD SEFF was in Bulgaria, soon followed by facilities in Poland and the Western Balkans.
