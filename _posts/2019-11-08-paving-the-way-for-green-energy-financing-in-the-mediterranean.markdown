In the face of a gathering climate crisis, “The world must quickly implement massive energy efficiency and conservation practices,” declared more than 11,000 climate scientists in a [statement](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806) issued November 5. Their warning lends added urgency to a program that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has been running for more than a decade, and which is now poised to expand in North Africa.

In 2006, the EBRD launched Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities (SEFFs) as part of its Sustainable Energy Initiative. Through these facilities, the bank provides credit lines to financial institutions, which in turn enables them to lend money on to their business clients for investment in energy-efficiency projects.

Since 2006, the EBRD has launched such facilities in 22 countries to encourage businesses and individuals to invest in green and renewable energy—leading to positive financial and environmental outcomes for businesses, residents, and communities. 

DAI’s first experience managing an EBRD SEFF was in [Bulgaria](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/bulgaria-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-credit-line-support-rational), soon followed by facilities in [Poland](https://www.dai.com/news/ebrd-launches-200-million-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-poland) and the [Western Balkans](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/western-balkans-sustainable-energy-finance-facility-webseff-i-ii). 

### Replicating SEFF in the Mediterranean

The success of its SEFF projects led the EBRD to replicate the model, and in 2013 DAI was awarded the first SEFF in the southern Mediterranean. The Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF) supports industrial companies’ investment in energy-efficient equipment—representing an environmental and an economic benefit in a country that, when MorSEFF was launched, was importing 90 percent of its energy needs. 

The €110 million allocated to MorSEFF included financial contributions from EBRD, Agence Française de Développement (AFD), Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the European Union (EU). Those funds were on-lent to industrial companies willing to invest in green-energy equipment and complemented by EU-funded technical assistance or grants to participating companies.
