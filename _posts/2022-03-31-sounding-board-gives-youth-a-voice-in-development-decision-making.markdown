Although many high-income countries are [getting older](https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-06/WPAM.pdf), the global population remains young. According to the [World Youth Report](https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210050029/read), the number of 15- to 24-year-olds reached 1.8 billion in 2020, representing about 15 percent of the total population. And these figures are expected to increase.  

Including the perspectives of young people in global development has long been touted as important, but the policy instruments for youth inclusion, participation, and empowerment don’t always adequately reflect that principle. In 2020, the European Union (EU) launched a project called [Analysis of Youth-Related Policies and Actions and Future Recommendations](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-analysis-of-youth-related-policies-and-actions-and-future-recommendations). Led by DAI, it identified best practices for donor-funded activities focusing on young people around the world and its research informed the creation of the EU’s [Youth Sounding Board](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/youth-sounding-board_en), a digital platform to provide young people a voice on international development cooperation.  

## How Young People Can Contribute to Sustainable Development 

Almost 90 percent of all people under 25 live in low-income countries, a large share of them in Africa and Asia. Many of them battle challenges such as high unemployment, persistent conflict, the adverse effects of climate change, and a lack of access to decent education and healthcare, all of which prevent them from thriving.  

Research by the project team shows that while many donors do have mechanisms for including young people in programs, these mechanisms often fail to bring in young people at critical moments. Young people are typically included as “beneficiary” groups, for example, but rarely brought into related policy decision making or the monitoring and evaluation processes. If youth empowerment is defined as enabling young people to participate in decisions that affect them and their communities, giving young people a tangible and significant impact on those decisions, many development programs are not meeting that objective.
