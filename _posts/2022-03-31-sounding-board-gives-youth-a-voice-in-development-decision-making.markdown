Although many high-income countries are [getting older](https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-06/WPAM.pdf), the global population remains young. According to the World Youth Report, the number of 15- to 24-year-olds reached 1.8 billion in 2020, representing about 15 percent of the total population. And these figures are expected to increase.  

Including the perspectives of young people in global development has long been touted as important, but the policy instruments for youth inclusion, participation, and empowerment don’t always adequately reflect that principle. In 2020, the European Union (EU) launched a project called [Analysis of Youth-Related Policies and Actions and Future Recommendations](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-analysis-of-youth-related-policies-and-actions-and-future-recommendations). Led by DAI, it identified best practices for donor-funded activities focusing on young people around the world and its research informed the creation of the EU’s Youth Sounding Board, a digital platform to provide young people a voice on international development cooperation.
