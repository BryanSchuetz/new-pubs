The terms “Machine Learning” and “Artificial Intelligence” conjure up feelings that are equal parts fear and fascination. Why is that? Until recently, the prospect of a piece of software making human-like decisions resided safely in the far-fetched expectations of 1960's era computer scientists, and in the plot lines of science fiction novels. Today, however, after [decades of unmet expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter), we finally have AI systems that are beginning to augment our lives. Voice recognition systems like Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri, and once-unimaginable fantasies like self-driving cars are on the market for consumers, with more exciting life-like systems to come. 

Where did the fear of AI come from? Perhaps the long period of expectation is the source of the anxiety. Had the internet, for example, been advertised and predicted for years prior to its rapid adoption, maybe more would have feared its repercussions. But no one really saw it coming! With AI, like an alien spaceship making a slow descent onto our planet, we’ve all been discussing over the last 50 years about what it will bring or do to our society. And right on cue, some early benign forms of those fears are being realized. A Russian robot [escaped a lab and made it into the world](http://qz.com/709161/its-happening-a-robot-escaped-a-lab-in-russia-and-made-a-dash-for-freedom/), leading some to question whether a robotic uprising is near. Leading minds in technology are indeed adding to those fears, with both [Elon Musk](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/10/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-fear) and Stephen Hawking clearly stating that AI is a threat it humanity. Acknowledging this and the ethical implications of an AI driven society, the White House recently [published a paper warning against the over-reliance on algorithms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2016_0504_data_discrimination.pdf) to make important decisions. 

There are undoubtedly millions of safe and useful applications of this trans-formative technology. So what is machine learning and how much of it is in our lives today? ML is a branch of AI that relies on data, and we, the addicted users of the internet have been providing the training data for the last 15 or so years. ML is indeed here and in our lives in many helpful ways. Language translation services on the web learn from gigabytes of translated text constantly fed into the system, Google’s self-driving cars are learning by driving millions of miles of roads. Facebook can auto-caption images to help visually impaired users partake in social media. Even the postal service is using these new technologies. Ever wonder why it is so cheap to send a letter across the country? The USPS uses ML to read hand-written addresses and automatically route them to their destination. Other parts of the government are using ML to [automate easy decisions](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/18/automating-easy-government-decisions-with-machine-learning/). On the horizon are [self-flying personal planes](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories), because apparently automating a path through the air is easier than navigating a chaotic city street. Lifelike writing is getting better too. Can you tell who wrote these poems: [human or machine?](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/06/27/480639265/human-or-machine-can-you-tell-who-wrote-these-poems)

Let’s be clear: the potential for our international development work is huge. USAID’s WIE project is looking at machine learning as way to automate the alignment of unstructured CVs and resumes with available jobs. This type of large-scale text processing is impossible to do with a handful of humans but made entirely achievable with the help of software that can read and make an educated guess based on the rarity of the terms in a CV. 

But don’t we always need a human in the loop? Well, yes most of these systems still need close human supervision. But before we continue marching around on our non-robotic high horse, let’s reflect for a moment on the hilariously flawed ways we make decisions today. Here are a few: Parole boards make decisions differently later in the day, because of [decision fatigue!](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html) Is that fair? The great lengths researchers go to just to prevent [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is astounding. We, with our own money and against our own judgement, make poor investment decisions based on cognitive biases like [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs). Actually, just look at this huge list of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), or patterns that lead us to make irrational decisions. Is human judgement really that great?
