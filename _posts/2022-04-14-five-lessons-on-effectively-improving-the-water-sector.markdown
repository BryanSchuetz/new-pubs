When the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the [U.S. Global Water Strategy](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/water-and-sanitation/us-global-water-strategy) (2017–2022), it set an ambitious target of reaching 15 million people with sustainable drinking water services and 8 million with sustainable sanitation services. 

The agency designed the Water and Development (WADI) contract as an umbrella mechanism to procure activities in support of these goals. As DAI recently wrapped up WADI projects in Haiti, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, and a regional project covering Africa, we brought in a third-party evaluator—[Aguaconsult](https://aguaconsult.co.uk/)—to illuminate which activities had proved most effective. This evaluation yielded the five lessons presented below.

## Lesson 1: “Hardware” Must Be Complemented By Technical Assistance and Other “Soft” Interventions

The water sector has largely shifted away from an infrastructure-first approach, with development partners acknowledging that interventions need to holistically address ongoing service delivery, thereby complementing the impact of shiny new facilities. Our projects primarily focused on technical assistance and governance-related interventions, using infrastructure investments strategically to improve service provider performance. 

For example, the [USAID Water and Sanitation Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-usaid-water-and-sanitation-watsan) in Haiti is using a data-driven utility reform model centered on the World Bank’s Utility Turnaround Framework to achieve service provision goals set by the service providers themselves. This approach came to be highly valued by local stakeholders as the utilities demonstrated significant performance gains, raising revenues as well as improving operations. Despite its initial desire to prioritize infrastructure, the Government of Haiti now sees USAID’s work as a model and is scaling up aspects of the project—such as an mWater-developed data management system—to all 28 utilities across the country. 

The importance of “hardware” interventions that complement technical assistance should not be overlooked, however. Among the analyzed projects, it proved consistently important to be able to support targeted infrastructure activities—such as installing meters or repairing networks—where these hardware interventions were in turn critical to achieving service delivery goals. For example, the [Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (KIWASH)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-integrated-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-project-kiwash) project and the [Lebanon Water Project (LWP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/lebanon-water-project-lwp) upgraded, extended, or rehabilitated existing infrastructure in ways that complement technical assistance designed to improve efficiency, reduce operating and maintenance costs, and increase resilience. 

Layering “hard” and “soft” interventions within a single demonstration zone shows how these types of interventions can work in tandem to maximize impact. For example, LWP implemented infrastructure, civic engagement, water demand management, and private sector engagement interventions all in well-defined areas. Sequencing these interventions can be a challenge, however, if hardware interventions are fully dependent on other sector actors, and projects cannot deliver quick wins for service providers.

The appropriate blend of hard and soft interventions will vary, by necessity, depending on where a country is on its development journey. As countries mobilize and direct more of their internal budgets toward infrastructure and sector development, development partners can dedicate more of their budgets toward “software,” eventually moving towards graduation from traditional development aid. 

All of our country-specific projects included investments in both infrastructure and technical assistance, but the proportion targeted toward hardware interventions was relatively higher in Haiti, a fragile state with large infrastructure needs, than in Indonesia, where the existing infrastructure is more expansive and the government devotes significant public resources to the water sector. In all cases, the review underscored the importance of ensuring that infrastructure is designed to support service providers in achieving performance goals and is not driven by top-down political priorities.
