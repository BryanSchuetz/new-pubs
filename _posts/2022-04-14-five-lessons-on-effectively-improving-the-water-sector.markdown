When the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the [U.S. Global Water Strategy](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/water-and-sanitation/us-global-water-strategy) (2017–2022), it set an ambitious target of reaching 15 million people with sustainable drinking water services and 8 million with sustainable sanitation services. 

The agency designed the Water and Development (WADI) contract as an umbrella mechanism to procure activities in support of these goals. As DAI recently wrapped up WADI projects in Haiti, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, and a regional project covering Africa, we brought in a third-party evaluator—[Aguaconsult](https://aguaconsult.co.uk/)—to illuminate which activities had proved most effective. This evaluation yielded the five lessons presented below.

## Lesson 1: “Hardware” Must Be Complemented By Technical Assistance and Other “Soft” Interventions

The water sector has largely shifted away from an infrastructure-first approach, with development partners acknowledging that interventions need to holistically address ongoing service delivery, thereby complementing the impact of shiny new facilities. Our projects primarily focused on technical assistance and governance-related interventions, using infrastructure investments strategically to improve service provider performance. 

For example, the [USAID Water and Sanitation Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-usaid-water-and-sanitation-watsan) in Haiti is using a data-driven utility reform model centered on the World Bank’s Utility Turnaround Framework to achieve service provision goals set by the service providers themselves. [This approach](https://medium.com/usaid-global-waters/creating-a-roadmap-for-sustainable-water-service-delivery-in-haiti-e67128d7ac98) came to be highly valued by local stakeholders as the utilities demonstrated significant performance gains, raising revenues as well as improving operations. Despite its initial desire to prioritize infrastructure, the Government of Haiti now sees USAID’s work as a model and is scaling up aspects of the project—such as an mWater-developed data management system—to all 28 utilities across the country. 

The importance of “hardware” interventions that complement technical assistance should not be overlooked, however. Among the analyzed projects, it proved consistently important to be able to support targeted infrastructure activities—such as installing meters or repairing networks—where these hardware interventions were in turn critical to achieving service delivery goals. For example, the [Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (KIWASH)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-integrated-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-project-kiwash) project and the [Lebanon Water Project (LWP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/lebanon-water-project-lwp) upgraded, extended, or rehabilitated existing infrastructure in ways that complement technical assistance designed to improve efficiency, reduce operating and maintenance costs, and increase resilience. 

Layering “hard” and “soft” interventions within a single demonstration zone shows how these types of interventions can work in tandem to maximize impact. For example, LWP implemented infrastructure, civic engagement, water demand management, and private sector engagement interventions all in well-defined areas. Sequencing these interventions can be a challenge, however, if hardware interventions are fully dependent on other sector actors, and projects cannot deliver quick wins for service providers.

The appropriate blend of hard and soft interventions will vary, by necessity, depending on where a country is on its development journey. As countries mobilize and direct more of their internal budgets toward infrastructure and sector development, development partners can dedicate more of their budgets toward “software,” eventually moving towards graduation from traditional development aid. 

All of our country-specific projects included investments in both infrastructure and technical assistance, but the proportion targeted toward hardware interventions was relatively higher in Haiti, a fragile state with large infrastructure needs, than in Indonesia, where the existing infrastructure is more expansive and the government devotes significant public resources to the water sector. In all cases, the review underscored the importance of ensuring that infrastructure is designed to support service providers in achieving performance goals and is not driven by top-down political priorities.

## Lesson 2: Strong Partnerships Drive Successful Service Delivery Reform—But Take Time to Create

Across all five projects, expanded access to sustainable water security, sanitation, and hygiene (WSSH) services relied on forming strong partnerships with local sector actors. Being responsive to the needs of local partners and accountable for commitments to them are key to building these effective relationships. 

Under the [Water for Africa Through Leadership and Institutional Support (WALIS)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-water-africa-through-leadership-and-institutional-support-walis) project, governments developed their own requests for WALIS’s training and equipment support to build the data and monitoring systems they wanted. Working with service providers and local governments, our projects developed performance improvement plans, governance regimes, and monitoring tools to help set service delivery and management goals and co-designed the support that would help achieve them. Partnerships with the private sector and financial institutions were equally important in driving change in the WSSH sector. 

LWP, for example, facilitated a partnership between the South Lebanon Water Establishment and Cash United, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. This contract allowed for the expansion of customer points of service, online bill payment, electronic points of sale, and door-to-door bill collection service for the utility. The project acted as a trusted, neutral broker to facilitate relationships among governments, service providers, and the private sector.

To achieve these enabling partnerships, our projects embedded staff in sub-national government or utility offices. After an initially slow start in gaining traction with local partners in Kenya, KIWASH embedded staff—including service provider capacity building specialists, WSSH governance specialists, and engineers—within county government offices. Similarly, the USAID Water and Sanitation Project in Haiti and LWP embedded staff within utility offices, using government and utility protocols, staff, and reporting channels to deliver project results. In both cases, this approach meant that project staff became trusted partners who had a clear understanding of the day-to-day challenges, could tailor solutions, and were readily available to provide technical support when needed, while also strengthening local systems. It is critical that embedded staff do not displace local talent, so our projects worked to ensure that we supported and built capacity and did not directly undertake work that is best performed by government or utility staff.

WADI projects typically work across multiple jurisdictions, where local governments and service providers have varying capacities, operate in different socio-economic contexts, and progress at different rates. Building strong relationships allowed us to tailor support based on an intimate understanding of the different needs and opportunities presented by those contexts. These different rates of progress within a single country can also afford opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, which we found to be a valuable approach to building capacity. In some cases, utility partners were more likely to internalize lessons from their counterparts rather than from “outside” experts. For instance, KIWASH facilitated a benchmarking visit of staff from utilities in Kitui and Makueni to two of the best-performing utilities in Kenya, where the four providers collaborated to transfer strategies for nonrevenue water management. 

But building valuable and durable partnerships takes time—often more time than a typical five-year project allows—and benefits from consistency in personal relationships. Once locally sustainable partnerships are established, our projects can taper their support, eventually exiting entirely.
