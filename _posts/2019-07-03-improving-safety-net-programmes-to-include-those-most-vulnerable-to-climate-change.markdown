Tanzania’s population of 60 million people is projected to double by 2050. As with many low-income countries, Tanzania’s livelihoods and food supply largely depend on livestock and rainfed agriculture and fisheries, despite increasing urbanisation. The climate supporting these conditions is projected to break down through the 2050s with warmer temperatures, longer droughts and heat waves, and increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events, among other changes.




As other countries have done, the Tanzanian government in 2013 launched a safety-net programme to assist its 1.1 million extremely poor households—almost 15 percent of the population—by providing cash transfers and other forms of social protection. The programme is being assisted by the World Bank and others and aims to reduce extreme poverty and break its intergenerational cycle. Reviews indicate that the safety net performs well and its benefits provide meaningful assistance.

But will investments in safety nets increase the resilience of the poorest beneficiaries in countries where livelihoods hinge on climate change? DAI was hired to analyse Tanzania’s Productive Social Safety Net to find whether the programme was increasing climate resilience among the poorest people. The answer was … no, at least not directly.

However, in countries where livelihoods are highly exposed and sensitive to climatic shocks, the analysis provided instructive takeaways for current and future safety-net programmes.

1.	Who is most harmed by climate change?

The disproportionate impacts of climate change may lead some to assume that the poorest will always be the most adversely affected. After all, in Tanzania and elsewhere the poorest often live rural or pastoral lives, that is, their livelihoods are largely dependent on the climate.

But droughts, floods, and other disasters linked to climate breakdown will most directly affect people who hold vulnerable assets—such as smallholdings or livestock—which distinguishes them from the poorest people who directly benefit from safety nets.

The poorest may suffer indirectly through increased local food prices due to climate-related events, as they are unlikely to have sufficient income to meet increased food costs. For example, rural beneficiaries of Tanzania’s safety-net programme already spend up to 91 percent of their income on food. The poorest may also be indirectly impacted because they often rely on climate-vulnerable neighbours for work or assistance.

2.	Can social protection programmes improve resilience to climate change?
Safety-net programmes that target only the poorest people—and not those who own assets—have limited ability to improve climate resilience. To address the impact of climate change, programmes such as Tanzania’s would need to expand their scope beyond the poorest to include households that own assets such as land and livestock but are not wealthy enough to rebuild following disaster or afford resilience-enhancing measures such as drought-resistant crops, irrigation, or infrastructure.

These potential beneficiaries may not require year-round support but only in the lead-up to, during, and/or immediately after disasters to minimise or eliminate disruption. Developing this type of shock-responsive social protection requires significant up-front and long-term investment. For example, the expansion of Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net Programme—including for emergency cash transfers—has been ongoing for 10 years in its design and transition to government management. Countries wishing to expand social protections against climate change should anticipate needing to register beneficiaries beyond regular recipients, establish and maintain early climate-warning systems, and agree upon payment triggers.

3.	Who really benefits from public works programmes?

Many social protection programmes, including Tanzania’s, include a labour-intensive public works or “cash-for-work” component. These programmes offer paid work—particularly during months when little agricultural work is available—such as clearing drainage, building resilience-enhancing infrastructure such as earthen dams for irrigation and livestock, or planting mangroves to mitigate coastal erosion.
Governments and donors often assume these infrastructure projects are a “win-win” for the poor, providing paid work to build a community asset. But once again, the poorest gain little when public works such as dams primarily benefit those who hold assets such as livestock and farmland. For example, our Tanzania research found that water from dams built through public works—while good for irrigation and livestock—was unsuitable for human consumption, requiring the poorest to continue to walk long distances for safe drinking water.

Despite these issues, public works programmes are often key to social protection programmes by providing visible public assets and counteracting stereotypes that social welfare recipients are unwilling to work. If public works programmes wish to meet resilience-enhancing objectives, they should:

1.	Focus on public assets of value to everyone, and particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, such as clean, safe drinking water sources that are free at the point of use.

2.	Contain sufficient regularity of work days and wage rates.

3.	Ensure those who cannot perform demanding labour are not penalised and instead provided with unconditional transfers.

Predictable, reliable safety-net support can help the world’s poorest people endure times of hardship and enable them to work or gain access to vocational training and their young to attend school. If safety nets can be designed to include those most vulnerable to climate change—such as poor farmers—this could increase the resilience of the poorest safety-net beneficiaries with whom they coexist.

**Tanzania’s Climate**

Historical climate trends:

* Increased average temperature of 1°C (1960– 2006) with little change in overall precipitation.
* Accelerated loss of glacial volume on Mount Kilimanjaro with an 85-percent reduction of the Kibo Summit Glacier from 1912 to 2009.
* Rise in sea levels of 4–20 centimetres per decade (1955–2003) everywhere except Zanzibar, which recorded a decrease in sea levels (1984–2004).

Projected changes by the 2050s:

* Increased average annual temperature of 1.4 to 2.3°C.
* Increased duration of heat waves (by 7–22 days) and dry spells (by up to 7 days).
* Likely increase in average annual rainfall (range of -3 to +9 percent).
* Increased heavy rainfall event frequency (7–40 percent) and intensity (2–11 percent).
* Rise in sea levels of 16 to 42 centimetres.
* Disappearance of glaciers from Kilimanjaro.
