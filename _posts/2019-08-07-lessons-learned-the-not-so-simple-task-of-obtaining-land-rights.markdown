The promise of land rights in developing countries goes something like this: Once an individual has secured land and property rights, he or she is more empowered and more able to participate in the economic growth of his or her community. Add in the multiplier effect and voila—a developing country begins to move toward economic growth and stability.

Of course, nothing in global development is quite that simple. The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) has been a leader since 2000 in driving the momentum to help lower-income countries to develop more robust and efficient land administration systems. DFID’s approach to land tenure regularization (LTR) has now been adopted and implemented in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Tanzania. In Guyana, DFID assisted in the transition of the land administration to enable it to become an autonomous administrative body with financial sustainability—part of this task was the regularization of leasehold lands and rehabilitation of the leasehold registry.






Overall, DFID programs have issued more than 20 million individual or joint land titles across Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Tanzania and 1,400 community titles in Mozambique. Critically, more than 50 percent of the beneficiaries have been women. The process and methods used have proved particularly successful in helping women achieve more secure land rights. Formal land market activity has increased in areas of implementation and LTR methods have helped to significantly reduce localized disputes and wider conflicts related to land.

While these achievements are notable, ongoing challenges remain and understanding the impact of these is critical to the design and implementation of future programs. In particular, the expectations of governments and donors on what can be achieved through support to LTR and land administrations needs to be balanced against the need for complementary programs that are necessary to achieve real change. As with many development programs, sometimes outcomes take decades to become evident. This is especially true of the land sector.

In 2014, DFID launched the [Land: Enhancing Governance for Economic Development (LEGEND) programme](https://www.odi.org/projects/2798-land-enhancing-governance-economic-development-legend) to mobilize knowledge and capacity for design and implementation of country programs, improve inclusive land governance and economic development, and scale land and property rights.

The team at LEGEND recently turned to DAI to review the six large-scale land projects that took place in the countries mentioned above.

Here are nine key takeaways from the review:

**1. Don’t go it alone.** If successful, LTR provides individuals and groups with secure land and property rights. This provides the basis for increased economic growth, access to credit, increased investment, and land market activity. LEGEND found that while there is some positive correlation, programs must have complementary market systems or financial access components. For example, the [Ethiopia Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-land-investment-transformation-lift) programme, implemented by DAI, not only invests in low-cost land certification and policy reforms but also in market system interventions to maximize impacts on land investment and productivity. 
**2. Iron out, not ignite.** Disputes over ownership of land and access to natural resources can often ignite or exacerbate social and political instability. LTR processes, applied in a participatory manner to clarify access rights and ambiguities of boundaries, bring dispute issues into focus within a community and facilitate routes to evidence based mediations and eventual resolution. LTR processes have also addressed [gender and social inclusion](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/lift-ensuring-women-and-vulnerable-groups-reap-full-benefits-of-land-certification-in-ethiopia) by promoting greater transparency and equal access to land rights. Women’s empowerment and decision making on land use and investments has also demonstrated a range of benefits associated with the household at large. LIFT has specifically boosted women’s economic empowerment, with 89 percent of titles issued to female household members listed jointly or individually. The report notes that while LTR procedures for first registration are effective, sustainability of the land administration system for the long term must be the main objective if all of the benefits are to be realized.

**3. Get it right.** To increase transparency, reduce corruption, and raise revenues, land registries must be accurate and secure with proper investments made to ensure the system and capacity meet requirement in the long-term. In the [Rwanda Support for Land Tenure Regularisation](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/rwanda-support-land-tenure-regularisation) programme, taxes and fees associated with LTR have generated $3.4 million in 2017–2018 and this is expected to double in three to five years.
**4. Getting government on board.** To reach the greatest scale in the most cost-effective means, strong government commitment and ownership of the process must be achieved. While this is a prerequisite for most development programs, issues of land tenure and land administration reform usually lies across a diverse range of institutional actors with competing priorities, ranging from inter-ministerial to national and subnational structures and to communities themselves and the customary authorities. Strong government commitment combined with consistent communication and participatory approaches is required for successful design and implementation. In Rwanda, only by taking a two-phased approach, through strengthening both public and Government understanding of the requirements for registration and land administration reform in the first phase, could the second nationwide phase and downstream investment be undertaken. 
**5. Include all voices.** Detailed understanding and assessment of how minority, women, and marginalized groups access and hold land also must be included in a successful design and implementation. Not just understanding these gender and social parity dynamics but also how they intersect with the legal framework itself. Projects in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and [Tanzania](https://usaidpubs.exposure.co/her-land-rights) all showed that when [women’s voices](https://usaidpubs.exposure.co/her-land-rights) were included in the process, the outcomes were more equitable and provided a platform for women to assert their property rights. 
**6. Over-communicate.** Social inclusion requires effective communication for people to feel informed and included in the decision-making process with key messages being government approved. Messages must include the purpose of LTR, the long-term benefits, and the process and procedures that must be followed to ensure it is sustained.
**7. Good systems make good programmes.** To maximize all of these elements, systems themselves—administered by trained professionals—are paramount. Land registries’ purpose is to maintain and provide accurate records of property ownership, ongoing transactions, the value and use of land, land parcel mutations (subdivisions and consolidations). Once an LTR is in place, governments may use revenues generated by fees for the service to cover costs and promote further investment in the services. Further, land administration systems should be seen through supply and demand economics. The demand side requires land owners utilize statutory of formalized systems, while the supply side is established through a first registration or an LTR program. Post-LTR systems must be sustainable, accessible, and cost-efficient with sufficient capacity within the institutions responsible. In Rwanda, there are proven benefits to registering transactions, which has generated a significant increase in demand for services. 
**8. Context matters.** LTR and land administration programs are context-specific. One size does not fit all. Land registration is useful when land markets are evolving rapidly or farmers require secure land rights to obtain credit. In other circumstances, strengthening collective rights of community systems by issuing titles to associations or whole communities may be appropriate to ensure security and empower communities to manage their land rights more effectively where development is expanding rapidly. This is the system currently adopted in Mozambique. 
**9. Tech (when it helps).** Using low-cost GPS, tablets, and drone technology with customized IT infrastructure can reduce the cost of mapping and recording land rights. However, it is important that technology not hinder nor replace the real benefits that accrue from participatory mapping approaches.

The experience of DFID over the past 20 years has given implementers and governments a solid evidence base on how to achieve more effective land tenure and land administrations reform over the long term through support to large national programs. Sharing the detail of these lessons is vital to ensure that programs continue to improve in design and implementation for the financial, social and governance benefit of recipient countries.
