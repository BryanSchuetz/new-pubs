Last time, in (Consumer Insights Indonesia: Mobiles & Workforce Development)[dai-global-digital.com/consumer%20insights/2016/04/26/indonesia-consumer-insights.html], I laid out the context,who we interviewed, and why we were in Indonesia in the first place. This time, its straight to the insights:

## 1. **BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is the 800 lb. gorilla of messaging apps, particularly among young people.**

Why BBM when WhatsApp dominates in so many other geographies?  Long ago, before the Android democratized the smartphone space, (Blackberries accounted for almost half (43%) of all mobile phones sold in Indonesia)[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/lack-of-global-knowledge-has-cost-blackberry-indonesia/article21432165/]. This quote says it all:

> “Three years ago, all we knew about selling phones was selling BlackBerrys – nine out of 10 phones we sold were BlackBerrys,” Mr. Chandra says. “Now, it’s one out of 10. I barely sell any.”

Three years later, BlackBerry phones are about as popular in Indonesia as cross country skiing--not very. The above-quoted article puts BlackBerry's share of Indonesia's smartphone market at 3% as of the mid-2014, a 40% drop from the the heights of 2011. IDC, a global market research firm, doesn't bother to include Blackberry among the (country's top selling smartphone brands)[https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP41041116].

The one remaining vestige of the BlackBerry's former halcyon days of domination is BBM, and while the company's all-or-nothing bet on the physical keyboard didn't pan out, their saving grace may have been the decision to port BBM over to Android. When people left their BlackBerries behind, they took BBM with them to a new platform, and today the app (counts some 55 million users in Indonesia)[http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/29/why-blackberry-is-a-hit-in-indonesia/], ahead of both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, eachof which have about 50 million users.

Those are the numbers writ large, but within our sample--young people between the ages of 16 and 24--BBM absolutely steamrolls the competition. See the two graphs below; The first shows the apps which young people most commonly mentioned among their favorites, irrespective of type or usage. The percentages listed show the percent of our sample that pegged the app as a favorite. BBM was the favorite with 63% of respondents mentioning it, followed by Facebook at 47%, WhatsApp at 21% and Instagram and UC Browser bringing up the rear.

The second graph shows the number of self-reported messages per day by platform among users of that platform (as opposed to among our entire sample). BBM users sent 110 messages per day, 266% more than SMS users, who sent an average of 30 messages per day. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger users reported sending 7 and 5 messages a day per those platforms, respectively. Anecdotally, older professionals and people in government that I met tended to use other apps like WhatsApp or Line to communicate, while it seems that young people are barely using these apps.

## 2. If BBM is an 800 lb. gorilla, Facebook may be 1800 lb. gorilla

Facebook is nearly omnipresent in Indonesia. 

This graphic shows how young Indonesians participate in information flows. We asked them how they receive information about news, social events, jobs, and training opportunities and found that while TV remains an important source of information,

## 3. **More and more, youth are turning to their mobile phones for information about job and training opportunities.**

We used a Likert scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree) to gauge Indonesian youth perceptions of the utility of their phones in the search for job and training opportunities. We asked three questions:

* My mobile phone will help me find new educational/training opportunities,
* My mobile phone will help me find a new or better job in the next year, &
* My mobile phone is useful for communicating with my teachers/professors.

The answers were almost unanimous: between 78% and 90% of youth strongly agreed or agreed with each of these three questions. See the graphic below for the breakdown.
