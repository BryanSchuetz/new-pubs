Earlier this month I had the good fortune to attend the [Global Accelerator Network’s](http://gan.co) annual [Rally]( https://twitter.com/hashtag/ganrally) out in Denver. The Global Accelerator Network (GAN) includes 70 startup accelerators in 100 cities across six continents.

## What exactly is a [startup accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_accelerator)?

It’s a mentorship program for budding entrepreneurs. Generally, after a competitive application process, accelerators provide startups with limited funding, office space to operate, mentorship, opportunities to network with venture capitalists, and a demo day to show off their tools, all in exchange for a small (6-10%) stake in the company. Some of the best known accelerators are [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/) and [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

## This year’s Rally...
...brought together accelerators from all over the world, including:

* [Carao Ventures in Costa Rica](http://www.caraov.com/)
* [Orion Startups in Mexico](http://hello.orionstartups.com/)
* [Ampersand-et in Colombia](http://gan.co/members/view/ampersand-et)
* [UTEC Ventures in Peru](http://www.utecventures.com/)
* [AltCity in Lebanon](http://www.altcity.me/)
* [H-Farm Ventures in Italy](http://www.h-farm.com/en/)
* [The Summer Institute](http://www.summerinst.ca/) and [Ideaboost](http://www.ideaboost.ca/) in Canada
* [Sparklabs in Korea](http://www.sparklabs.co.kr/)
* [Lightning Lab in New Zealand](http://www.lightninglab.co.nz/)
* [Startup Raykjavik in Iceland]( http://www.startupreykjavik.com/)
* [STING in Sweden](http://www.stockholminnovation.com/en/our-programs/sting-accelerate/)
* [01Booster in Japan](https://01booster.com/)
* [Startupbootcamp in the UK](https://www.startupbootcamp.org/)

...all to discuss how to better support the stars of the startup world: [the founders](http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/7-rockstar-female-founders-share-their-best-startup-advice.html). 

## The Same Coin
Throughout the week I heard a lot of ideas about how to improve startup mentorship, training opportunities, and access to venture capital, but my primary take-away was that accelerators and development actors are really two sides of the same coin: We’re both trying to help local people solve local problems, we’re just doing it in different ways. 

Accelerators solve local problems by empowering entrepreneurs with the training and tools they need to achieve market sustainability; development organizations help solve local problems by empowering citizens, civil society organizations, and local governments with the training and tools they need to achieve sustainable social, economic, and political impact. 

## And yet, our worlds are not entirely distinct 
There’s a strong trend among entrepreneurs to focus not just on opportunities to turn a profit, but opportunities to have social impact *and* turn a profit. This movement, called [social impact investing](https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/), “challenges the long-held views that social and environmental issues should be addressed only by philanthropic donations, and that market investments should focus exclusively on achieving financial returns.” The Global Impact Investor Network [reports in its 2016 Annual Impact Investor Survey](https://thegiin.org/assets/2016%20GIIN%20Annual%20Impact%20Investor%20Survey_Web.pdf) that more than $15 billion was invested in impact-oriented projects in 2015, with almost $18 billion planned for 2016.

## The Silicon Phenomenon
There's a growing segment of the social sector that thinks of itself not as simple charity, but as market actors responding to market needs. And as the [Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/disrupt-your-market) says:

> “Foundations, funders, and nonprofits today increasingly talk about “investments” rather than grants. “Start-ups” and “ventures” receive “seed funding”, where new organizations once simply secured core funding. Executive Directors are becoming CEOs, and “capacity building” is now “incubation.”

## To review
1. Startup acceleration has become a worldwide phenomenon, supporting the growth of innovation ecosystems in many of the countries where USAID works. Among those represented at the rally, The Agency is working in Costa Rica, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Lebanon.
2. Just like donor-funded development, start-up accelerators exist to help local people solve local problems. 
3. Social impact investing is a growing area for venture capitalists with a social conscience, as the global startup ecosystem and the nonprofit sector start to converge. 
4. There remain significant differences between the two particularly when it comes to incentives, as the [Engine Room rightly points out](https://www.theengineroom.org/disrupt-your-market/), but the unifying incentive is to solve people's problems, and to do so sustainably. 

## Hey USAID, want to promote innovation?
Based on what we've discussed, here are a few ways to drive innovative problem solving in the countries where USAID operates. 
*This list is brief and it doesn't tread into the ongoing discussion about how to better define innovation, improve procurement processes, shift risk calculations, and adjust M&E frameworks to be more agile, although I consider all of those to be important as well.*

1. **Invest in startup ecosystems and the people driving them.** 
Missions should be integrating with local startup ecosystems (almost every medium to major city has one), helping accelerators grow, supporting events, investing in socially-focused concepts (which attracts more concepts), and pushing the local private sector to do the same. DAI has been actively involved with the innovation ecosystem in Colombia through the recent [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://dai-global-digital.com/top-3-climate-change-concepts-from-the-2016-nasa-space-apps-challenge-bogota.html), in Afghanistan where we've been [supporting the growth of Tech-for-Good](https://dai-global-digital.com/sowing-the-seeds-of-a-tech-for-social-good-ecosystem-in-afghanistan.html), in [El Salvador](https://dai-global-digital.com/innovation-and-entrepreneurship-in-el-salvador.html) through the Puentes al Empleo project, and in Cambodia through the [Development Innovations](https://www.facebook.com/DevInnoKH/) project. Finally, DAI, Montgomery County, Maryland, USAID, and GAN recently hosted the [Innovation into Action Challenge](https://dai.forms.fm/innovation-into-action-challenge), we're now looking for ways of taking the same model into the places we work. 

2. **Include innovation funds in project RFPs.** DAI has had success in Cambodia through our [Development Innovations](http://www.development-innovations.org/success-stories/) project in using innovation grants, but this approach could be expanded significantly to prove incentives for local entrepreneurs. Also, instead of innovation grant funds, consider establishing an innovation venture fund, which would allow the project more flexibility in contracting methods and partners.

3. **Reconsider risk calculations.** Not every investment into the startup ecosystem is going to pay off with the next Uber or AirBnB; USAID Missions must push the Agency (and vice versa) to experiment, and to open space for implementing partners (both international and local) to try new things. The "Uber of civic engagement" might be out there, we just need to create the conditions for entrepreneurs to try (and fail) until we figure it out! 

Do you have additional ideas of how USAID could support innovation? I'd love to hear them! Let us know on Twitter @DAIGlobal.
