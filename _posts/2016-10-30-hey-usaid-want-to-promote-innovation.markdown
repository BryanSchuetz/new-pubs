Hey USAID, want to promote innovation?

Earlier this month I had the good fortune to attend the [Global Accelerator Network’s](http://gan.co) annual [Rally]( https://twitter.com/hashtag/ganrally) out in Denver. The Global Accelerator Network (GAN) consists of 70 startup accelerators, in 100 cities across six continents.

## What exactly is a [startup accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_accelerator)?
It’s a mentorship program for budding entrepreneurs. Generally, after a competitive application process, accelerators provide startups with limited funding, office space to operate, mentorship, opportunities to network with venture capitalists, and a demo day to show off their tools, all in exchange for a small (6-10%) stake in the company. Some of the best known accelerators are [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/) and [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

This year’s Rally brought together accelerators and startups from all over the world, including:
*Those based in countries where DAI does operate*
* [AltCity in Lebanon](http://www.altcity.me/)
* [Carao Ventures in Costa Rica](http://www.caraov.com/)
* Orion Startups in Mexico](http://hello.orionstartups.com/)
* [Ampersand-et in Colombia](http://gan.co/members/view/ampersand-et)
* [UTEC Ventures in Peru](http://www.utecventures.com/)

*Those based in countries where DAI doesn’t operate but still loves*
* [H-Farm Ventures in Italy](http://www.h-farm.com/en/)
* [The Summer Institute](http://www.summerinst.ca/) and [Ideaboost](http://www.ideaboost.ca/) in Canada
* [Sparklabs in Korea](http://www.sparklabs.co.kr/)
* [Lightning Lab in New Zealand](http://www.lightninglab.co.nz/)
* [Startup Raykjavik in Iceland]( http://www.startupreykjavik.com/)
* [STING in Sweden](http://www.stockholminnovation.com/en/our-programs/sting-accelerate/)
* [01Booster from Japan](https://01booster.com/)
* [Startupbootcamp in the UK](https://www.startupbootcamp.org/)

And to discuss how to better support the people who are the stars of the startup scene: the founders. Throughout the week I heard a lot of ideas about how to improve startup mentorship, training opportunities, and access to venture capital, but my primary take-away was that accelerators and development actors are really two sides of the same coin: We’re both trying to help local people solve local problems, we’re just doing it in different ways. 
Accelerators solve local problems by empowering entrepreneurs with the training and tools they need to achieve market sustainability; development organizations help solve local problems by empowering citizens, civil society organizations, and local governments with the training and tools they need to achieve sustainable impact. And yet, our worlds are not entirely distinct from one another: And as the [Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/disrupt-your-market) asserts, 
> “Foundations, funders, and nonprofits today increasingly talk about “investments” rather than grants. > “Start-ups” and “ventures” receive “seed funding”, where new organizations once simply secured core > funding. Executive Directors are becoming CEOs, and “capacity building” is now “incubation.”

there’s a strong trend among entrepreneurs to focus not just on opportunities to turn a profit, but opportunities to have social impact and turn a profit. This trend, called [social impact investing]( https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/), “challenges the long-held views that social and environmental issues should be addressed only by philanthropic donations, and that market investments should focus exclusively on achieving financial returns.”

focuses not on monetary return on investment, but on impact return on investment. 

For obvious reasons, these two approaches are starting to merge. More and more, startup entrepreneurs are taking on
