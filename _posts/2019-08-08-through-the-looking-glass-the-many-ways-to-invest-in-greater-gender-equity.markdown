*“Where shall I begin,” asked the White Rabbit. “Begin at the beginning and go on ’till you come to the end,” said the King rather sensibly in the often-quoted line from Lewis Carrol’s Alice in Wonderland.*

We often hear the same question when it comes to gender-lens or gender-smart investing. Businesses and investors have varying levels of knowledge, interest, and commitment to making the private sector more equitable for women. In the United States, a 2018 report on [impact investing trends](https://www.ussif.org/trends) identified $868 billion in institutional investor assets under management that take gender-lens issues into consideration, more than double the $397 billion identified in 2016. Others find the phrase gender-lens investing confusing or intimidating and, like the White Rabbit, wonder where to begin. Perhaps, fortunately, our answer is not as direct as the King’s: We believe that there are many ways businesses and investors can begin to enhance gender equity, according to what works for them.






We recently attended a workshop called Getting Gender Smart, hosted by the [Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship (CASE)](https://centers.fuqua.duke.edu/case/), a research and education center at Duke University focused on developing the business skills needed to create social change, and [Catalyst at Large](http://www.catalystatlarge.com/), a company that provides consulting, speaking, and facilitation for gender-lens investing. The training emphasized that there are several lenses to consider, including what you invest in, what impact you’re trying to achieve, and what commitments you need to balance. We think that this strategic approach is a useful way for interested parties to explore this topic, decide where to begin, and ultimately carve their own path—without falling down the rabbit hole.

If you are an investor considering a particular opportunity through a gender lens, it may be helpful to consider the following five questions:

**1. Will your investment support businesses with women in senior leadership and strategic decision-making positions?** In a [2017 Deloitte analysis](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/risk/articles/women-in-the-boardroom5th-edition.html) of nearly 7,000 companies in 60 countries, women held just 15 percent of all board seats. Yet, in a [study of 3,000 companies](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/credit-suisse-research-institute-releases-the-cs-gender-3000-the-reward-for-change-report-analyzing-the-impact-of-female-representation-in-boardrooms-and-senior-management-300332558.html) around the world, sales growth and return on assets were higher in companies where women occupied 50 percent or more of leadership positions. According to [other research](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/2018-03-22/invest-in-gender-equality-for-strong-portfolios), “Companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least number of women, on average, by 53 percent on return on equity, 42 percent for return on sales, and 66 percent for return on invested capital.” Having women in leadership and decision-making positions provides businesses with access to more talent and a greater diversity of ideas to spur innovation and growth. It also creates better insights into women customers, including their needs and preferences, which helps to expand the customer base, tailor services to its needs, and create new opportunities for the business. Touting these benefits as well as the moral case for greater gender equity in the private sector, the [Thirty Percent Coalition](https://www.30percentcoalition.org/) advocates for women to hold at least 30 percent of board seats in all U.S. public companies.

**2. Will your investment support increased or equal access to investment, loans, and equity for women-owned businesses?** [Between 63 and 69 percent](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/2018-03-22/invest-in-gender-equality-for-strong-portfolios) of small and medium women-owned businesses in developing economies have less access to capital than those owned by men, according to the International Finance Corporation. That means that an alarming number of businesses with great ideas, talented leadership, and the potential to generate much-needed employment in developing economies face a greater risk of failure; thus, opportunity is lost for everyone, solely because women have fewer chances to access the financing that any business needs to survive.

**3. Will your investment support businesses with an equitable workplace environment for women or support the improvement of the workplace environment to become more equitable?** Widespread inequality in compensation for men and women, inadequate family leave or restrictions on flexible working hours, and workplace cultures that tolerate and/or normalize sexual harassment create barriers for women’s success—and, by extension, that of the business. Unsurprisingly, a [growing body of literature](https://paxworld.com/the-investment-case-for-gender-equality/) shows that when businesses eliminate pay gaps and provide equal opportunities for women and men, they outperform their competitors. Businesses that condone harassment, on the other hand, suffer higher turnover. According to one study, [80 percent of women](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217704631) who have been harassed leave their jobs within two years. In the United States, harassment costs the economy an estimated [$4.4 million in lost wages](https://paxworld.com/the-investment-case-for-gender-equality/) and 973,000 hours of unpaid leave each year.

**4. Will your investment support a business or businesses that create and/or market products and services tailored to women?** U.S. Trust research found that women’s total income globally [surpassed $15 trillion](https://www.businessinsider.com/women-could-be-the-next-global-growth-engine-2015-10), a value far larger than China’s economy and second only to the U.S. economy. With so much excitement about the investment potential in China and other so-called emerging economies, it is a wonder that investors have not better capitalized on the promise of the global women’s economy. 

**5. Will your investment support supply chains that include women-owned businesses and provide employment for women?** Diversifying global supply chains by incorporating more women as wholesalers, intermediaries, and frontline service providers supports gender equity outside of a business’s own employees and leads to increased resilience, access to a broader talent base, and employment for women across a range of jobs.

As these questions demonstrate, there are multiple interpretations of, and possibilities for, gender-lens investing, from investing in women-led companies to better catering to women employees and customers. Of course, having more women enter careers in investing and financial services could help too. More women in leadership positions in fund management, for example, and equal access to capital for investment funds that employ women could have a multiplier effect on any of the other actions described above. There is no fixed path for improving gender equity in the private sector; investors can decide what to prioritize given their own unique skills and resources, as well as their financial and social objectives and commitments.

## Charting Your Own Path

*“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” asked Alice. “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” the Cheshire Cat replied.*

Whether you choose one of the strategies described above or multiple, you may be wondering: Where do I go from here? What will it cost me? Do I have to go all in? The Gender Smart Investment Menu presented in the training offered several levels of “gender intentionality,” best described as the type of achievement you seek when it comes to gender equity goals. For some investors, avoiding harm by using objective criteria to remove or exclude certain businesses from their portfolios, such as those with a history of sexual harassment (e.g. The Weinstein Company), may be a sensible place to start. Others may seek a more proactive approach, pursuing incremental change by investing in gender-positive opportunities, such as in businesses employing women or creating equitable workplace environments. Still, others may look to generate more transformational changes in their investment portfolios or industries, such as those investing in financial inclusion or businesses that promote women’s economic empowerment.

Of course, a commitment to advancing gender equity and other social goals must be balanced with the financial return needed by the investor or business. Would an investor accept a smaller rate of return if a business fulfilled certain gender objectives? Which gender-related objectives could be targeted that might coincide with even larger financial returns? Here, too, there are multiple paths, which is precisely the point: contrary to the King’s remark, there is no required place to begin and no prescribed point at which to end.

Depending on their specific goals, investors and businesses have many different opportunities to use a gender lens in what they do – whether investing for capital preservation or a market rate of return, avoiding practices and investment choices that disadvantage women, or actively seeking to shape portfolios and industries to advance gender equity. While this might not be your usual cup of tea, we hope you’ll consider taking a look through the (gender) looking glass.
