<aside id="footnote-1">* The Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund focused on market system change and women’s economic empowerment in Egypt, Jordan, and until March 2018, the occupied Palestinian Territories. From June 2020 to October 2021, AWEF 2 focused on Egypt only. AWEF developed an innovative and path-breaking approach to market systems to encourage the adoption of new practices and approaches to support WEE.
