[Jeffrey Mecaskey](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/jeffrey-mecaskey) is the Team Leader of the [Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-tackling-deadly-diseases-in-africa-program), a project designed to strengthen health security in Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Uganda. Tackling deadly diseases in Africa (TDDA) is funded by UK Aid and led by DAI Global Health.

We recently sat down with Jeff to find out more about an article he recently co-authored for the Bulletin of the WHO, titled Measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries. The article analyses data from 20 low- and middle-income countries to identify common deficiencies in primary health care (PHC) provision. The article argues PHC is an accessible way to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and makes practical, evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice.
