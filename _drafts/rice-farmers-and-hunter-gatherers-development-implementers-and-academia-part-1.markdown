Walk through most any office in the international development community and you’re likely to see bookshelves straining to hold the weight of insightful, data-rich academic research. But that research rarely finds application in program implementation. Why not? Academics and implementers share the same goals, so what disconnection keeps research from finding its way to application?

It is a question of culture. Donors and their implementing partners are rice farmers, and academics are hunter-gatherers. The two are not naturally wired to work well together. 

Rice farming societies tend to organize themselves into well-defined, stratified roles in order to manage the infrastructure necessary to deliver their crop. Either the whole village eats or nobody eats, and so intricate social structures and networks emerge. The cadence of the agricultural calendar beats at the heart of it all, with clearly defined tasks, each depending on their own prerequisites, having a fixed place in a schedule that is implicit and understood by everyone involved.

Hunter-gatherer societies are organized on different principles. Food is collected by individuals or small groups, not as a single event with many prerequisites but as a continuous flow of ad hoc, freestanding tasks. As such, hunter-gatherers tend to form less rigid hierarchies than rice farmers, allowing them more flexibility and personal latitude.

Architected for accountability to funding organs and foreign policy objectives, the approach of donors and implementing partners resembles that of rice farmers. Development projects are executed by many actors with defined roles, with – ideally – clear accountabilities to funders and stakeholders. Successful implementers develop deep interlinkages with partners and stakeholders on the ground, maintain close contact with local political and other realities in order to change priorities and methodologies as those realities shift, and effectively manage large teams to the cadence of work plans and results frameworks.  

University researchers work within something more like a hunter-gatherer culture, architected for academic integrity and accountable to networks of peers within and outside their home institutions. Successful researchers are deeply grounded in the technical details of their areas of interest and effectively argue their conclusions to an audience presumed to be critical, while managing their schedule to the cadence of teaching, publishing, and representational responsibilities.

Like any two cultures that come together, implementers and researchers do not always understand each other’s contexts, or even realize what they misunderstand. Most development implementers and academics who have worked together have had that experience at least occasionally. Fortunately, effectively bridging cultural gaps is something we all do for a living. Like other connections we splice every day, we can make it work.

I have heard implementers working with academics (and in truth, academics working with academics) describe it as “cat herding”. I strenuously resist this characterization, and not just because it introduces an animal husbandry dimension that threatens to muddle my already tenuous agricultural metaphor: if you are herding cats, you are doing it wrong. If you need an animal that works well in herds, best not choose cats; if you need cats, then find ways to let them be successful as cats. That may require you to learn new strategies, but if you expect cats to behave like cows, you cannot blame the cats when that goes badly.

In my next post, I will explain some of the cultural gaps that need to be understood and addressed if researchers and their working contexts are to be successfully integrated into the systems that implementers use to get development results.
