Like many countries, Honduras was forced to close its schools by COVID-19. As a result, the [Asegurando la Educación (Securing Education)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-securing-education) project—a U.S. Agency for International Development project to support safe schools—was forced to give up its face-to-face interaction with educators, students, and parents. But necessity is the mother of invention and, in this case, expansion. Today, by means of webinars, videos, and a digital awareness campaign, we are reaching record numbers of beneficiaries. Transitioning to remote learning has not only forced us to rethink our strategies for reaching students—it is prompting us to rethink how we reach beneficiaries more effectively. 




Before virtual implementation, the Executive Leadership Program for Principals (PELE), for instance, trained an average of 45 school administrators from one or two cities per session. Since the in-person training already focused on equipping school principals with skills to lead during times of crisis, Asegurando quickly [streamlined its content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkTqAE0ApJWkB6Sw7t0JnVB8KHLKPe5J) for online delivery, holding the first session just weeks after schools shut down.

Instead of spending staff time and resources on logistics, transportation, food, and venues for 3 separate in-person events that reached 100 principals in 3 or 4 cities, the project can now reach more than 1,000 participants in 230 cities, while expending far fewer resources. The sessions are having a positive impact on new beneficiaries as well. Principal Otilia Padilla in Siguatepeque—a city not reached before the pandemic—said, “After the training, I met with my teachers to search for other strategies that will keep students… from dropping out of school.” By November, 7 PELE sessions have registered 4,857 unique participants from 230 cities, with an average of 1,239 connecting per webinar.

### Support for Teachers’ Wellbeing

Through another digital adaptation, Asegurando’s Teacher Wellbeing program began offering safe, virtual spaces for teachers to share difficult experiences and emotions with their peers. Before the pandemic, this emotional health and wellbeing activity was not a top priority; in fact, we had only implemented it for 30 educators per session over a 3-month span, and in only 82 of Asegurando’s 135 schools, with no continuation plans for 2020. However, the pandemic’s emotional impact on educators revealed a clear need for the program.
