Welcome to [GeekFest 2017](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=geekfest-2017), a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #Geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.
\
This week I’m speaking to, [Jessica Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berlinjessica/?ppe=1), Managing Director of CoStruct and founding partner of MakerNet based in – you guessed it – Berlin, Germany. Before taking the leap as an entrepreneur, Jessica worked for a number of German and US government organizations and development agencies as well as nonprofits in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America – an experience that inspired her to start her own initiative building public-private partnerships to create new systems around business and technology innovation in emerging economies.

**Q: Tell us about MakerNet and where you see its potential for transforming business as usual in development?**
\
[MakerNet ](http://www.makernet.global/)is a consortium of interdisciplinary organizations working together to connect local makers to manufacturing resources and supply chains. Oftentimes we see that global supply chains, even within the aid sector are heavily reliant on products and components that are imported internationally at a great cost, when the skills to develop local solutions exist on the ground. We aim to connect young people and businesses with technical manufacturing skills to resources such as makerspaces and free, open source designs to facilitate their entry into these supply chains.
\
**Q: How do you go about doing this?**
\
We just wrapped up our [pilot program in Kenya](http://www.makernet.global/blog/2016/10/27/makernet-in-nairobi) in February, where we set out to prove the hypotheses that a) the is a demand for locally sourced materials/components in the international aid sector in Kenya, and b) that that supply can viably be met by local suppliers. For the pilot we focused on the [medical sector](http://www.gearbox.co.ke/blog/2017/2/13/makernet-event), as we realized that a major issue that under serviced clinics and hospitals in Kenya are having is replacing relatively simple components of medical equipment that break down due to wear and tear. Some clinics had machinery that was lying around idle for months simply because a basic component needed to be replaced.
\
Our makers reverse engineered a number of such components – a[ heating elemen](http://movement.makepedia.org/tools/autoclave-repair-replace-heating-element)t for an autoclave machine, a malfunctioning valve from an oxygen machine, and broken [centrifuge tube holders](http://movement.makepedia.org/tools/centrifuge-spare-part-tube-holders) – and managed to manufacture replacements in our Makerspace for these clinics using open source designs. We also managed to manufacture a [3-D printed fetoscope](http://movement.makepedia.org/tools/3d-printed-fetoscope), the design of which we ultimately brought to a local carpenter that could take the design and manufacture them out of preferable [wooden materials](http://movement.makepedia.org/tools/wooden-fetoscope) using a simple lathe machine. So what we were able to do was to show that not only is there a strong demand for low cost, readily sourced replacement parts in the medical sector, but that the tools, materials, and skills to create the supply were also there. We also showed that it could all be done using open source designs, which we have published to our[ Makepedia](http://makepedia.org/) platform.
\
**Q: How do you envision this type of work being able to transform livelihoods?**
\
The nature of open source design is a democratizing force in global manufacturing. The same way that open source software has enabled anyone with the skills to contribute to software projects and adapt software to their needs while also licensing their own versions, open source manufacturing combined with common makerspaces that offer resources to skilled individuals and businesses allows people to become a part of supply chains that they previously didn’t have access to. This can be transformative on both sides – aid agencies and companies will be able to source materials quicker and more cheaply, and local makers can gain access to new customers.
\
**Q: Where is MakerNet now that you've successfully completed the pilot?**
\
We are looking to bring our approach to new sectors and new geographies and to expand our network of makers and other stakeholders. We’ve begun bringing together operational stakeholders such as makers and makerspaces and academics and research programs, as well as governments and donors to explore our best opportunities for expansion. We’ve managed to prove our hypothesis regarding demand and supply in Kenya – now we are realizing that in order for our approach to commercialize and scale in the long term, we need to focus on tackling some of the more systemic barriers, specifically local regulatory frameworks. We now need to determine and understand what sorts of approval processes are required in different countries for international open source designs to be approved by local regulatory agencies in different sectors whether in Kenya, Nigeria, India or elsewhere where they might be sold. Of course, these regulations differ from country to country and so it is quite a challenging task, but certainly not impossible.
\
Another challenge that we are beginning to tackle is on the open platform front. We developed [Makepedia](http://makepedia.org/) – an open source design-sharing platform – and are exploring the question of how we can incentivize makers the world over to properly document their designs and innovations so that they can be more easily replicated. There is quite a significant amount of research going on at German universities in this area, which is why we are looking to increasingly draw in universities and research institutes to our work to help apply their research to applications in development.
