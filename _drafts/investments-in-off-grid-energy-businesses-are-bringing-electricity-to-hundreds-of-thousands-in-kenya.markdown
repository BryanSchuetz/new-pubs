On New Year’s Eve, 1879, approximately 3,000 people traveled to Menlo Park, New Jersey, to witness an [extraordinary sight](https://www.history.com/news/when-edison-turned-night-into-day): an entire street alight by electric lamps. Only three months after successfully prototyping what would become his most well-known invention, Thomas Edison introduced his light bulb to the public by illuminating his laboratory and a neighboring street with more than 60 carbon-filament bulbs. When one visitor inquired about the cost of powering the lamps, Edison quipped, “After the electric light goes into general use, none but the extravagant will burn tallow candles.”

Unfortunately, nearly 140 years later, Edison’s vision of affordable and accessible electricity remains unrealized for much of the globe.

Progress has been made. From 2007 to 2017, [global access](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.elc.accs.zs?end=2017&start=2007) to electricity grew by more than 6.5 percent, making 2017 the first year that the number of people without access dropped below 1 billion. [South Asia saw](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?end=2017&locations=8S&start=2007) a dramatic increase in the number of people with access to electricity, growing from 67 percent of the population in 2007 to nearly 90 percent in 2017.

However, in the same timeframe, in sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of the population with access to electricity grew by only [6 percent](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?end=2017&locations=ZG&start=2007). In 2017, approximately [940 million people](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.elc.accs.zs) worldwide still lacked access to electricity; an estimated 600 million of them in [sub-Saharan Africa](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG). That means approximately 55 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s total population lives and works without regular access to electricity.

### Powering Up

In response to Africa’s energy crisis, the U.S. Government in 2013 launched the [Power Africa](https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica) initiative, coordinated by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to produce 60 million new electricity connections across the region by 2030.

Unfortunately, the funding needed to electrify sub-Saharan Africa surpasses the combined amount available from African nations and international development agencies. Understanding this challenge, Power Africa teamed up with USAID [INVEST](https://www.usaid.gov/INVEST), a DAI-led initiative that mobilizes private capital for development, to increase access to solar home systems and mini-grids in areas across Kenya where access to grid electricity has previously been nonexistent or prohibitively expensive.

While grid expansion projects provide enough electricity to power large appliances and meet intense energy demands, they’re expensive and can take years to complete, especially in rural areas. Off-grid energy businesses, such as mini-grid and solar home systems, are essential to reducing the energy gap for households and businesses in Africa’s most underserved areas, and, in Kenya, they have the potential to scale rapidly. However, because these energy businesses do not have access to the expertise and support needed to navigate the complicated financial and operational realities that accompany growth, they often fail to reach this potential.

These businesses also struggle to connect with investors and banks that can offer the appropriate capital and terms required for company growth. In traditional markets, local banks often provide debt for working capital. Often, in countries where these off-grid energy businesses operate, local banks are unfamiliar with the sector, and their terms are often expensive.

INVEST, with Power Africa and USAID in Kenya, identified four high-potential off-grid energy businesses and provided each with customized transaction advisory services to support capital raises for financing growth.

One of these companies, [Azuri Technologies](https://www.azuri-technologies.com/), pioneered the [Azuri PayGo Energy](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/financing-for-climate-friendly/azuri-paygo-energy), a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model. PAYG models let rural customers have immediate access to basic electricity and provide enough power for household light, device charging, and smaller appliances (e.g., TVs and radios), based on their energy needs and budget.

Azuri, like most PAYG companies, charges a small, one-time installation fee for the system. Then, customers make manageable payments on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis via mobile money. For a basic Azuri home lighting system, customers pay KES49 a day, the equivalent of US $0.47. For a system that includes satellite TV, the cost is KES102, or about a dollar. To determine pricing, Azuri’s technical teams research a country’s average household spending on phone charging and kerosene. Azuri then undercuts that figure, which incentivizes people to switch to solar power systems for economic reasons. After 18 months of payments, customers own the system, thereby gaining access to a free, continued supply of electricity for as long as the system lasts (about eight to 12 years).
With INVEST’s assistance, Azuri attracted a US $26 million equity investment from Japanese corporation and Fortune 500 Global company Marubeni as well as additional investment from FTSE 250 company IP Group plc and PM Partners. Azuri’s growth is bringing safe, clean energy to thousands of people across Kenya, and INVEST’s support has put three other off-grid energy companies on the path to growth, too. Together, these four companies are projected to provide 390,000 new connections and 6,000 upgraded connections across the country. (Approximately, 25 percent of Kenya’s population, about 12 million people, lack access to electricity.)
It’s difficult to overemphasize the transformative effect access to electricity has on a life.
Access to education, an essential element of lifting people out of poverty, is dramatically hindered when children lack access to electricity. Approximately 90 million elementary school children in sub-Saharan Africa attend schools without electricity. Not only do their classrooms lack copy machines, projectors, computers, internet, and science equipment, but their schools struggle to attract talented staff members because many high-quality, educated teachers don’t want to live in unelectrified areas. Electrified schools are correlated with higher test scores and graduation rates, and they have higher enrollment and less absenteeism than their unelectrified counterparts.
