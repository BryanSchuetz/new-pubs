On New Year’s Eve, 1879, approximately 3,000 people traveled to Menlo Park, New Jersey, to witness an [extraordinary sight](https://www.history.com/news/when-edison-turned-night-into-day): an entire street alight by electric lamps. Only three months after successfully prototyping what would become his most well-known invention, Thomas Edison introduced his light bulb to the public by illuminating his laboratory and a neighboring street with more than 60 carbon-filament bulbs. When one visitor inquired about the cost of powering the lamps, Edison quipped, “After the electric light goes into general use, none but the extravagant will burn tallow candles.”

Unfortunately, nearly 140 years later, Edison’s vision of affordable and accessible electricity remains unrealized for much of the globe.

Progress has been made. From 2007 to 2017, [global access](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.elc.accs.zs?end=2017&start=2007) to electricity grew by more than 6.5 percent, making 2017 the first year that the number of people without access dropped below 1 billion. [South Asia saw](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?end=2017&locations=8S&start=2007) a dramatic increase in the number of people with access to electricity, growing from 67 percent of the population in 2007 to nearly 90 percent in 2017.

However, in the same timeframe, in sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of the population with access to electricity grew by only [6 percent](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?end=2017&locations=ZG&start=2007). In 2017, approximately [940 million people](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/eg.elc.accs.zs) worldwide still lacked access to electricity; an estimated 600 million of them in [sub-Saharan Africa](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG). That means approximately 55 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s total population lives and works without regular access to electricity.

In response to Africa’s energy crisis, the U.S. Government in 2013 launched the [Power Africa](https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica) initiative, coordinated by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to produce 60 million new electricity connections across the region by 2030.

Unfortunately, the funding needed to electrify sub-Saharan Africa surpasses the combined amount available from African nations and international development agencies. Understanding this challenge, Power Africa teamed up with USAID [INVEST](https://www.usaid.gov/INVEST), a DAI-led initiative that mobilizes private capital for development, to increase access to solar home systems and mini-grids in areas across Kenya where access to grid electricity has previously been nonexistent or prohibitively expensive.

While grid expansion projects provide enough electricity to power large appliances and meet intense energy demands, they’re expensive and can take years to complete, especially in rural areas. Off-grid energy businesses, such as mini-grid and solar home systems, are essential to reducing the energy gap for households and businesses in Africa’s most underserved areas, and, in Kenya, they have the potential to scale rapidly. However, because these energy businesses do not have access to the expertise and support needed to navigate the complicated financial and operational realities that accompany growth, they often fail to reach this potential.

These businesses also struggle to connect with investors and banks that can offer the appropriate capital and terms required for company growth. In traditional markets, local banks often provide debt for working capital. Often, in countries where these off-grid energy businesses operate, local banks are unfamiliar with the sector, and their terms are often expensive.

INVEST, with Power Africa and USAID in Kenya, identified four high-potential off-grid energy businesses and provided each with customized transaction advisory services to support capital raises for financing growth.

One of these companies, [Azuri Technologies](https://www.azuri-technologies.com/), pioneered the [Azuri PayGo Energy](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/financing-for-climate-friendly/azuri-paygo-energy), a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model. PAYG models let rural customers have immediate access to basic electricity and provide enough power for household light, device charging, and smaller appliances (e.g., TVs and radios), based on their energy needs and budget.
