It’s late January in Dhaka, which means I’ve managed to avoid its usual heat and humidity, but the bustle and throng are just what I’d expect of one of South Asia’s largest cities. Even though I grew up in India, I’ve never had the chance to travel to its sister republic to the east. And yet, all at once, everything seems familiar – the cars, the noise, the smells. My guide through the city is Ontiq Dey, an eager young graduate student of economics in the city and a seasoned data collector. He and he four of his classmates are DAI’s street team for our first ever [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) study in South Asia.

`Digital Insights data collectors gathering information from students in Mymensingh`

Digital Insights is in-person, ethnographic research designed to draw out meaningful insights into the media consumption habits and lives of communities around the world. As with our Indonesian Digital Insights [study](https://dai-global-digital.com/indonesia-digital-insights.html), we’re focused on urban youth – how do they connect? What sources of information do they trust? What are their favorite apps?

To answer these questions, we talked to 123 people across two urban centers – Dhaka and Mymensingh, a smaller town around 4 hours’ drive north of the capital.  We were lucky to get a fairly even male-to-female ratio of respondents. All of our respondents were between 18 and 38, with an average age of 25 (which, incidentally, isn’t far off from Bangladesh’s median age of 26.9). Given our urban focus, our sample skewed heavily towards students, working professionals and other educated categories.

So, what did we learn?

## Young urban Bangladeshis are incredibly well-connected, digitally speaking

As these statistics show, our sample revealed high levels of digital access among young Bangladeshis. Interestingly, these statistics remained consistent across genders and across different education and employment groups. As with other markets we’ve studied, the 3G data/ smartphone boom is largely responsible for this level of digital penetration.

## Facebook and Facebook Messenger dominate this market

Not only are Facebook and Facebook Messenger incredibly popular, but they easily outdo their competition in Bangladesh.  For example, in contrast to Facebook Messenger, only 61% of smartphone users reported using Whatsapp, and they only communicate with an average of 9 people on that platform per week. Only 42% reported using Viber, and 32% use Imo.

One of our respondents spoke about the speed with which information about local events spreads on Facebook: “We are very active on Facebook these days. Our neighborhood information is known faster from Facebook than from local elites or neighbors.”

We asked respondents what they did during their time on Facebook.  As expected, most of their Facebook activity centered on personal updates and sharing news (each of which got over 100 mentions), but curiously enough, only 20 people mentioned that they engage in debates on Facebook. I don’t know about you, but given the way my feed has looked over the last year or so, I’m ready to follow the Bangladeshis’ lead on this one.

[On a side note for browser geeks: a number of respondents mentioned that they really liked [UC Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UCMobile.intl&hl=en), which I found odd but interesting. On further question, I realized that UC Browser’s popularity received a bump a couple of years ago when young Bangladeshi’s discovered that it allowed them to bypass a [brief government ban on Facebook](http://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-lifts-ban-facebook/3097865.html).\]


## But despite Facebook’s dominance, it still doesn’t replace old school phone calls

While it was clear that Facebook dominates the digital market, it was also clear that digital tools haven’t replaced phone calls as the main means of communication. We asked our respondents how they keep in touch with friends, and almost 2:1, they mentioned phone calls over messaging apps. When talking to family, that ratio went up to 4:1.

## Social media dominates as a source of news, but ‘old media’ are still the most trusted

When asked about their primary sources of international news, respondents overwhelmingly cited social networks as their main source of information. However, when we asked them an open-ended question about the source they trusted the most, they mentioned BBC (33 mentions) and CNN (19 mentions). In domestic news, the balance shifted slightly away from social networks in favor of print and TV media.

In sum, Bangladesh’s digital usage, like much of South Asia, a great mix of old and new. There’s room for new tools, but the old way of doing things, whether that’s phoning up a friend or sitting down with the newspaper, still has a strong foothold even among millennials. Young Bangladeshis appear to have fully embraced the brave new digital world, but they haven’t let it get the better of them. Not yet, anyway
